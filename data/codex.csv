"Ability","All cards in the game have abilities! There are two categories of abilities: Basic abilities, which 
all units have without being printed on their cards. Special abilities, which is the card text on 
each card, or text granted to it by other effects, e.g. [[Black Obelisk]]. Cards also have 
characteristics, which are distinct from abilities.",""
"Activated Ability","An activated ability has a cost (such as tapping or paying mana) and an effect.  For example, 
[[Field Laborers]] have an activated ability. If you pay the cost, the effect occurs. If you can pay 
the cost multiple times, you may do so (and the effect will occur each time you pay the cost). 
Activated abilities may only be used On your turn, during your main phase, and when no events are 
pending on the storyline. Note that it's also possible for an activated ability to have no cost, in 
which case it will likely have some other limit, such as once on your turn. For example, [[Queen 
Guinevere]] has an activated ability with no cost, but is limited to once on your turn. Track your 
use of such abilities during your turn to ensure the game state remains clear to both players. By 
default, only the controller of a card can use its activated abilities.",""
"","","Activating Abilities:  To activate an ability, ensure that: You control the card with the ability 
It's your turn It's your main phase No events are on the storyline You can pay the cost Once you pay 
the cost and declare targets (if any), the effect of the activated ability goes on the storyline and 
then will resolve normally."
"Active Player","The active player is the player who is currently taking their turn.",""
"Adjacent","Adjacent refers to the current square and the four orthogonal squares that share a border with it 
(not diagonals). For example, the middle square has 5 adjacent squares - itself and four others.  If 
a square is in the corner of the realm, it will have fewer adjacent squares. For example, the bottom 
right square has only 3 adjacent squares - itself and two others.  When referring to adjacent sites, 
adjacent voids, or adjacent squares, the effect can cross the boundaries of regions. For example, 
[[Lord of the Void]] can be in the void and still banish an adjacent site, even though sites and 
voids are in different regions. [[Frontier Settlers]] can be on a site and still play your top site 
to an adjacent void, even though sites and voids are in different regions. For all other references 
to adjacent, such as adjacent locations, adjacent minions, adjacent artifact, etc., regional 
boundaries must be respected and cannot be crossed. For example, if a minion with Voidwalk was 
attacked while at a site and then played [[Dodge Roll]], it could not move to a void square because 
'adjacent location' cannot cross a regional boundary.",""
"Air Site","An air site is a site that provides at least one air (A) affinity. If the site provides other types 
of affinity as well, it's still an air site as long as it provides at least one air affinity.",""
"Airborne","Keyword ability. A unit with Airborne may fly while on the surface. It gains three benefits while on 
the surface: When taking a step, it may move diagonally. It cannot be targeted by attacks, unless 
the attacking unit also has Airborne. It cannot be intercepted, unless the intercepting unit has 
Airborne or Ranged. Important reminders: Attacks from Airborne units can be defended normally! 
Airborne is mostly a defensive ability and gives greater mobility, but Airborne attacks (against a 
unit or a site) can be defended by any unit, even without Airborne! The Airborne unit must swoop 
down to attack. Even if an Airborne attacker targets an Airborne defender, a non-Airborne unit may 
defend, since the original target can bring the fight down to the ground. Airborne only works on the 
surface. If the unit starts its step on the surface of a site, it can step diagonally. If the unit 
starts its step in a different region (void, underwater, underground), then it can't step diagonally 
(and also doesn't get the other benefits either). Airborne has no effect on counting distance for 
effects with 'up to X steps away,' e.g. [[Disenchant]].",""
"Ally","An ally is a unit that you control, including your Avatar. Allies are always units, unless otherwise 
specified by card text. For example, [[Cast into Exile]] uses 'allied site,' which means 'a site you 
control.'",""
"Animate","Animate means to give a card the minion type. It becomes a minion for the duration of the effect, in 
addition to its other types. For example, [[Enchantress]].",""
"Artifact","Artifacts are various relics, edifices, tools, gear, gadgets, devices, and baubles, often charged 
with lasting enchantments by wizards of old. [[Spear of Destiny]] is an example of an artifact. 
Artifacts have an artifact frame on their card, and typically do not require threshold. For example, 
[[Philosopher's Stone]] or [[Sword and Shield]]. Artifact subtypes include Armor, Device, Document, 
Instrument, Potion, Relic, and Weapon, which have no special game rules, though other cards may 
reference them. There are two special artifact subtypes, Automaton and Monument, which have special 
rules, described below. Artifacts have characteristics, specifically ((artifact characteristics)), 
and are one of the six card types in the game. By default, any non-Monument, non-Automaton artifact 
can be carried by a unit. If such an artifact is not carried, then it is not controlled by anyone. 
If such an artifact is carried, then it's controlled by the bearer's controller. The '((Casting 
Artifacts))' entry has details on how to cast artifact spells.",""
"","","Automaton:  Automatons are artifacts that are minions. See 'Cards With Multiple Types' in the 
'characteristics' entry for more details. [[Crave Golem]] is an example of an automaton."
"","","Monument:  Monuments are an artifact subtype that cannot be carried. [[The Immortal Throne]] is an 
example of a monument."
"As If Adjacent","Some effects allow movement 'as if adjacent' e.g. [[Minecart Madness]]. If it matters, the 
controller of the movement effect decides the cardinal direction when a unit is moving 'as if 
adjacent.' For example, if you have a [[Waypoint Portal]] active and you want to move your 
[[East-West Dragon]] through it, you can choose to consider the movement horizontal and Move Freely, 
even if the two squares are not the same row. Similarly, a [[Dalcean Phalanx]] could step through a 
Waypoint Portal to a square in a different column by declaring the proper cardinal direction for the 
'as if adjacent' movement. Units moving 'as if adjacent' do not cross any borders. Therefore, a 
[[Waypoint Portal]] would allow you to circumvent a [[Wall of Ice]] or [[Great Wall]], which look 
for crossing borders.",""
"As If Connected","Some effects allow movement 'as if the top and bottom edges of the realm were connected' e.g. 
[[Polar Explorers]]. To resolve these effects, imagine a duplicate copy of the realm ))above(( the 
top row, and ))below(( the bottom row. That is, those squares are considered adjacent for movement. 
Importantly, the squares are not actually connected for other effects, so something like [[Poison 
Nova]] on the top row wouldn't hit the bottom row, since Poison Nova isn't movement. Moving 'as if 
connected' does cross borders normally, and uses normal cardinal directions. Oversized units that 
move as if connected and then find themselves spanning the realm will immediately end up on one side 
or the other. See '((Oversized Units))' for more details. Most forced movement effects require 
proximity and thus won't work across the top and bottom edge when moving 'as if connected.' For 
example, [[Whirlwind]] could theoretically push across the top or bottom edge because a 'push' 
counts as movement, but you won't be able to select a 2x2 area that spans the top and bottom edges, 
because those rows are not actually connected; [[Polar Explorers]] merely allow movement 'as if' 
connected, not 'selecting 2x2 areas as if connected.' (In contrast, if [[Magellan Globe]] were in 
the realm, then you really could select 2 squares in the top row and 2 squares in the bottom row, 
because Magellan Globe actually connects the edges, for all purposes.) An example of a forced 
movement effect that would work is [[MaelstrÃ¶m]]:  [[MaelstrÃ¶m]] is at M, and [[Polar Bears]] are at 
P. The whole area is a giant body of water. You could pull normally to X, or could pull 'as if 
connected' to M since pulling is a form of movement.",""
"At Rest","The default state of a unit is at rest, but it stops being at rest when: It enters the realm, OR It 
moves or is moved, OR It casts a spell, OR It activates an activated ability or triggers a triggered 
ability. It returns to being 'at rest' after passive effects have been applied and the Storyline is 
empty. Here are some clarifying examples: If a [[Hillock Basilisk]] moves and attacks, the minions 
in the attacked location will be disabled before they have a chance to use their Defend triggered 
ability, because passive abilities apply before triggered abilities. But, a defending minion moving 
in from 1 step sideways will NOT be at rest because once that defending minion uses its triggered 
ability, it's no longer at rest. It won't return to being at rest until the whole attack sequence 
finishes. Also, it's doubly not at rest because it moved! Units being carried by other units will 
not be at rest while being moved. Units being forcefully moved by an effect like [[Grapple Shot]] or 
[[Windblast]] will not be at rest, since they're being moved.",""
"Atlas","Your atlas is your deck of sites and is one of the zones in the game. Only sites can be placed or 
shuffled into your atlas. If an effect would cause a spell card to be shuffled into an atlas, that 
effect is ignored. Constructed Format
Your atlas must contain 30 or more sites and respect rarity limits. Limited Formats (Draft or 
Sealed)
Your atlas must contain 12 or more sites, ignoring rarity restrictions.",""
"Atop","On the surface of a site (not void). Synonymous with 'above a site' and 'aboveground.' This includes 
Airborne minions, as well as all types of sites, including water sites.",""
"Attack","Attacking is one of the main ways you deal damage to your opponent's units and sites, and is a core 
part of Sorcery. Units attack as part of the Move and Attack basic ability. Certain rare effects may 
also explicitly allow attacks, e.g. [[Crave Golem]]. You may only attack enemy units or the surface 
of enemy sites that are at your location. When you attack, follow this sequence: Declare the attack 
target and check that it's a legal target right now. If not, end this process and no attack 
happened. Assuming the attack target is legal, 'attack' triggers are now satisfied and the defender 
has been targeted and attacked (e.g. [[Captain Baldassare]], [[Sir Kay]], [[Dodge Roll]], 
[[Wills-o'-the-Wisp]]). Resolve those, using the storyline rules as usual for ((simultaneous 
triggers)). Open the defend window. One unit may use the Defend ability, resolving its movement, if 
any. If it now occupies the attack's location, it joins the attack as a defender. If the original 
target was a site, it's removed from the attack. If the original target was a unit, it may remain in 
the fight or not, as the defending player chooses. Note that the defender is not 'attacked' nor 
'targeted.' The opportunity to use 'attack' triggers (e.g. [[Dodge Roll]], [[Wills-o'-the-Wisp]], 
etc.) has already passed. Repeat 3.a and 3.b as many times as defending player wants, one defender 
at a time. Defend window is closed. Check for attack target legality again. Units that used the 
Defend ability are automatically legal targets (e.g. a Stealth minion chooses to defend, a unit on 
[[Dome of Osiros]] chooses to defend, etc.) Resolve the fight. If there are no other units involved 
since you're attacking an undefended site, simply strike the site, damaging it and causing the 
controlling avatar to lose that amount of life. The attack is over. Any 'after attack' triggers 
resolve now.",""
"Aura","Auras are mostly incorporeal but lasting manifestations of elemental power.  They usually affect a 
2x2 area and can be cast anywhere in the realm. [[Entangle Terrain]] is an example of an aura. Auras 
have characteristics, specifically ((aura characteristics)), and are one of the six card types in 
the game. The '((Casting Auras))' entry has details on how to cast aura spells.",""
"Aura minion","An aura minion is a card that is both an aura and a minion! See 'Cards with Multiple Types' for 
details.",""
"Avatar","Your Avatar represents you and your connection to the realm. Every deck must contain exactly 1 
Avatar. Choose wisely! [[Sparkmage]] is an example of an avatar. Avatars have characteristics, 
specifically ((avatar characteristics)), and are one of the six card types in the game. Avatars are 
immune to many negative effects, as described in their characteristics.",""
"Banished","When you banish a card, it is removed from the game; place in a separate area, clearly distinct from 
any game zone. Once a card is banished, it can never return to the game.",""
"Basic Ability","All units in Sorcery have five abilities that are not printed on their cards. These are called basic 
abilities, and are described in their own codex entries: Move and Attack Defend Intercept Pick Up 
Drop",""
"Basic Movement","Basic movement is movement from the Move and Attack basic ability.",""
"Below","At the subsurface of a site (not void).",""
"Body of Water","A body of water is a contiguous group of adjacent water sites, regardless of who controls those 
sites. If a card refers to 'its body of water' or 'this body of water' (e.g. [[Anui Undine]] or 
[[Giant Shark]]), it means the body of water occupied by that card. If that card doesn't currently 
occupy a body of water, then it doesn't have a body of water. To choose a body of water (e.g. 
[[Marine Voyage]]), choose one water site. Every water site (regardless of controller) that's 
connected to the chosen site via adjacent water sites is in that body of water. If a site becomes 
disconnected from the chosen water site (e.g. [[Earthquake]] in the middle of the turn), the 
disconnected site is no longer in the body of water. If the chosen site is no longer a water site 
(e.g. [[Drought]] in the middle of the turn), then the 'chosen body of water' no longer exists.",""
"Border","A square's border means other adjacent squares and doesn't include diagonals. The border is the edge 
of the square, not including the corners. For example, [[Border Militia]] checks for adjacent enemy 
sites, not diagonals.",""
"Bottom","'Bottom' can have two different meanings in Sorcery, depending on context. When referring to your 
deck, bottom or bottommost simply means the bottom card of the deck. For example, [[Autumn River]]. 
When referring to the realm, bottom means the row closest to you. For example, [[Polar Explorers]].",""
"Broken Artifact","A broken artifact is an artifact that's in a cemetery.",""
"Bruin","Bruin is a token minion with 4 power. Bruin is a Unique Beast with 'While near your Avatar, Bruin 
takes damage for them.' Bruin is an ((earth)) minion. See [[Druid]].",""
"Burrowed Safely","Burrowed safely means that the minion has burrowing and can't move itself, while at this location. 
Typically an effect will cause the minion to unburrow, for example [[Awakened Mummies]].",""
"Burrowing","Keyword Ability. A minion with Burrowing can be summoned to underground locations and survive 
underground. By using one step, a minion with Burrowing can move between the surface and subsurface 
of a land site, or between adjacent underground locations. For example, [[Cave Trolls]] can be 
summoned underground to one of your land sites. Then, after their summoning sickness wore off, they 
could use their Move and Attack ability to take a step from underground to the surface of that site 
(and that would use up their step). If they were on the surface of a land site, they could use their 
step to move from the surface to underground of that site. To 'burrow' means to move from the 
surface to the underground of a land site. When an effect 'burrows' a card, you forcefully move that 
card from the surface to underground, even if it doesn't have the Burrowing ability. If an effect 
tries to forcefully burrow (e.g. [[Bury]]) a card that occupies at least one water site, the effect 
fails.",""
"Can vs. Can't","If one or more effects say you 'can' do something and one or more effects say you 'can't' do that 
same thing, the 'can't' effects always take precedence. For example, [[Queen Guinevere]] explicitly 
allows you to untap an allied minion, while [[Rhitta Gawr of Snowdonia]] prohibits other minions 
from untapping. If Queen Guinevere tries to untap any minion other than Rhitta, the effect will fail 
because the 'can't' effect from Rhitta takes precedence. Note that 'lose' effects (e.g. [[Sky 
Baron]]) also implicitly include a 'can't' effect. So if Sky Baron is in the realm and then you cast 
[[Power of Flight]], the 'can't' effect takes precedence and the minion doesn't gain Airborne.",""
"Can't be Modified","A card that 'can't be modified' cannot gain or lose any abilities, and it's characteristics cannot 
be changed. For example, [[Bedrock]] is not affected by [[Atlantean Fate]] nor [[Abundance]].",""
"Card","When you are instructed to draw a card, you may choose to draw a spell from your spellbook or a site 
from your atlas. If you draw multiple cards at once (e.g. [[Pact with the Devil]]), choose how many 
of each you'll draw, then draw all of them simultaneously. If a game effect or rule references a 
card in the realm, it includes tokens as well.",""
"Card Type","There are six different card types in Sorcery: Avatar Minion Artifact Aura Magic Site",""
"","","Multiple Simultaneous Card Types:  It is sometimes possible for cards to have multiple types. For 
example, automatons are minions and artifacts. For more details, see characteristics and 'Cards with 
Multiple Types.'"
"Cards with Multiple Types","It's possible for cards to have multiple types. For example, automatons are minions and artifacts. 
It's also possible for cards to gain types during the game. For example, [[Enchantress]] can cause 
auras to gain the minion type for a turn. When a card has multiple types, apply the following rules 
regarding characteristics: The default size remains unchanged. If the card was already occupying 
multiple locations (e.g. an aura) and becomes a minion (e.g. via [[Enchantress]]), it continues to 
occupy multiple locations even though minions default to a single location. For everything other 
than size, the characteristics of a minion take precedence. For example: Artifacts can be carried, 
while minions cannot be carried by default. Therefore, artifact minions cannot be carried as an 
artifact would be, since we give preference to the minion rules. Note that artifact minions can be 
carried as a minion would be carried (e.g. [[War Horse]]). Auras cannot carry artifacts. Minions can 
carry artifacts. Therefore, Aura minions can carry artifacts, since we give preference to the minion 
rules.",""
"Carriable Artifact","A carriable artifact is any artifact that's not a ((monument)) and not a minion (i.e. not an 
((automaton))). Carriable artifacts have additional options when being cast as a spell. See 
'((Casting Artifacts))' for more details, and '((Ownership and Control))' for details on how control 
can change for carriable artifacts.",""
"Carrying Artifacts","Many artifacts can be carried by units, and carried artifacts are moved along with the unit that's 
carrying them. For example, [[Ruby Core]] can be carried by a unit. See '((Carriable Artifacts))' 
for more details on which artifacts can be carried, and how control may change for such artifacts. 
See the 'Pick Up' and 'Drop' basic abilities, as well as '((Casting Artifacts)),' for details on how 
a unit might start or stop carrying an artifact. If an Oversized Unit is carrying an artifact, the 
artifact remains in a single location and maintains relative positioning to the Oversized Unit. See 
'((Oversized Units))' and '((Teleporting Oversized Units))' for further details. An artifact that's 
being carried must share at least one location with the unit that's carrying it. If they ever share 
no locations, the carried artifact is automatically dropped. Non-units cannot carry artifacts. If a 
non-unit is somehow carrying an artifact, the artifact is immediately dropped. If a unit is 
forcefully moved, anything they're carrying moves with them, e.g. [[Bury]]. If a minion leaves the 
realm, anything they're carrying remains in the realm, e.g. [[Fey Changeling]], [[Cast into Exile]], 
[[Monster Hunter]].",""
"Carrying Units","Normally, units cannot be carried by other units, but some effects allow it, e.g. [[War Horse]]. 
Such units have modified Pick Up and Drop basic abilities, as described in those codex entries. If 
such a unit loses the ability to carry other units, the carried units are immediately dropped. A 
unit that's being carried must share at least one location with the unit that's carrying it. If they 
ever share no locations, the carried unit is automatically dropped. Similar to carrying artifacts, 
the carried units are moved along with the unit that's carrying them. This is considered forced 
movement. If a carried unit cannot enter the location, the carried unit won't move (and will be 
dropped as usual if they no longer share a location with the carrying unit). For example, if a War 
Horse tries to carry a [[Bosk Troll]] into a [[Gnome Hollows]], the War Horse can enter the Gnome 
Hollows but the Troll cannot, and thus the Troll remains where it was and is automatically dropped. 
Units that can carry other units confer their movement abilities to the carried units while they're 
carried. For example, [[Phantom Steed]] can pick up a [[Bosk Troll]] and then carry the Troll into 
the Void. The Troll will have Voidwalk while being carried by the Phantom Steed, and thus be able to 
survive in the void. Carried units may take the Move and Attack action normally (once the Storyline 
is empty). Therefore, even if the carrying unit can't Drop that turn, the carried unit could still 
move themselves normally. For that first step, they will have any movement abilities conferred to 
them by being carried, which are lost as soon as they're no longer carried. For example, a Bosk 
Troll on a Phantom Steed in the void could step from the void onto the surface of an adjacent site, 
using the Voidwalk ability conferred to them by being carried. Once the Troll is on the surface of a 
site, it's no longer being carried by the Phantom Steed, but by that point it's safely in on the 
surface.",""
"Casting Spells","Spells are the main way Avatars and other Spellcasters influence the realm. You cast minions, 
artifacts, auras, and magics. You can only cast a spell during your main phase, while the storyline 
is empty. (A few cards like [[Dodge Roll]] grant a timing exception.) When you cast a spell, follow 
this process: Choose the Spellcaster. This is often your Avatar, but it can be any Spellcaster you 
control. If your Spellcaster occupies multiple locations, choose the location where they're casting 
the spell. For example, [[River of Flame]] occupies two locations, surface and subsurface; when it 
casts a spell, you must choose if it's casting from the surface or subsurface location. Reveal the 
spell and confirm you have the necessary threshold and mana to cast it. Note: Both players are 
responsible for confirming that all spells are cast legally! The most common spellcasting mistake is 
having insufficient threshold. Make it a regular practice to check threshold on every spell that's 
cast! Choose additional details based on the type of spell. See ))below((. Once you've done those 
three steps, you actually pay the cost to cast the spell and the card moves from where it was 
(usually your hand) and enters the storyline. It will then resolve according to the normal storyline 
rules.",""
"","","Casting Minions:  To cast a minion spell, you must declare the minion's summoning location. By 
default, you must choose the surface of one of your sites. Some abilities may modify what summoning 
locations you may choose. For example, minions with Burrowing may be summoned directly to 
underground locations you control. The summoning location must be a legal location for that minion 
to enter at time of casting (regardless of what might happen after the spell is cast and enters the 
storyline). For example, you could not choose [[Gnome Hollows]] as the summoning location of an 
[[Autumn Unicorn]]."
"","","Casting Artifacts:  To cast an artifact spell, you must declare the artifact's conjuring location. 
By default, you must choose the surface of one of your sites. If it's a carriable artifact, you may 
alternately choose one of your units and declare a location occupied by that unit; when the artifact 
enters the realm, it will be carried by that unit."
"","","Casting Auras:  To cast an aura spell, you must declare the conjuring location(s). The aura's card 
text will often specify conjuring details, but by default, auras occupy 2x2 areas and can be 
conjured anywhere in the realm. Auras occupy the surface of sites and the void. To represent the 
aura's locations, place the card at the intersection of the squares it occupies."
"","","Casting Magics:  To cast a magic spell, you must declare all targets of the magic. For example, if 
you cast [[Arc Lightning]], you must declare the 'target nearby unit' at the moment you cast the 
magic spell. When the magic goes on the storyline, the target will have been chosen and can't change 
later when the magic resolves. Note that some magic spells do not use the word 'target' and instead 
use a word like 'ally.' For example, when you cast [[Overpower]], you do not need to specify which 
ally you will choose, and instead you simply select the ally when the spell is resolving from the 
storyline. Finally, there are a few magic spells that don't target directly, and instead cause an 
ally to target. In that case, you also do not need to specify targets when you cast, since you only 
need to declare the targets that the magic itself is targeting. For example, if you cast [[Joust!]], 
you do not need to declare the target when you cast the magic; you select the ally when the magic is 
resolving from the storyline, and then the ally (not the magic!) does the targeting at that time."
"Cemetery","Your cemetery represents a record of your contest in the realm. Whenever any of your cards are 
discarded, destroyed, or resolved, place them face-up in your cemetery. Players may freely examine 
the contents of any cemetery at any time, and the order of the cards in a cemetery is irrelevant. 
Each cemetery is a zone in the game.",""
"Changelog","When the codex or card FAQs have notable changes, we'll list them in this entry.",""
"","","Changelog - July 14, 2025:  Codex Fixed the order of layers in '((Apply Ongoing Effects In Order))' 
so that disabling and silencing effects apply before control changing effects, so that [[King of the 
Realm]]'s ability can be properly disabled and silenced! FAQ Clarified that [[Silence]], [[Sisters 
of Silence]], and [[Magnetic Muzzle]] are silence effects. Yes, that confirms Magnetic Muzzle has no 
effect on Avatars."
"","","Changelog - July 10, 2025:  First release of the codex! Notable rule updates include: When attacking 
undefended sites, the attacking unit strikes the site, damaging it. When a site is damaged, the 
controlling avatar loses life equal to the damage dealt. This impacts cards like [[Mask of Mayhem]], 
[[Daperyll Vampire]], and [[Free City]], among others. For Move and Attack, you don't declare your 
attack target in advance; you simply resolve your movement (and any triggered abilities), and then 
choose to attack if you want. 'Attack' triggers only happen once, based on the initial target of the 
attack (e.g. [[Dodge Roll]] only works if the target was directly attacked, not if they Defend.) 
'Attack and kill' triggers (e.g. [[Battlemage]], [[Sea Raider]]) resolve as long as there was an 
attack, for each minion killed, based on kill credit. When a unit defends, it automatically becomes 
a legal target for the attack, superseding the silver rule. (e.g. If I attack [[White Hart]] and you 
defend with a different minion, that minion is now a legal target for the attack) Intercept triggers 
when an attack doesn't happen, not when a unit enters a location. Therefore, movement never gets 
stopped by intercept, and speedy units with Movement +X can slip by defenses. 'You' means the 
player, so for [[Deathspeaker]], [[Enchantress]], [[Templar]], and [[Sparkmage]], any of your 
spellcasters can cast the spell, not just your avatar. Stealth breaks when you interact with the 
realm. Non-minions can't have stealth. A unit can't activate the Drop ability after they interact 
with the realm in a given turn. Airborne works on avatars! Immobile means can't move itself. 
Immobile units can now attack and defend at their location. Units that carry other units - if the 
carried unit can't move in the chosen direction, the unit doing the carrying still moves. If the two 
units then don't share a location, the carried unit is automatically dropped. Auras can be cast to 
anywhere, including all void if desired. Oversized units (often called large units in the past) have 
an official term. Also, effects that specify 'its site' or 'its location' mean 'a site it occupies' 
or 'a location it occupies' for oversized units. This is relevant for cards like [[Spin Attack]]. 
Clarified how ((cost)) is calculated, including alternate costs like [[Aramos Mercenaries]] combined 
with [[Maddening Bells]]. Clarified the application of ongoing effects, which changed some previous 
FAQs, like [[King of the Realm]] vs. [[King of the Realm]]. Clarified application of damage 
replacement and damage prevention effects. Replacement effects always go first (e.g. Lance, 
[[Critical Strike]], [[Golden Harp]], and get ordered by the controlling player as they wish. Damage 
prevention effects (e.g. [[Shield Maidens]], [[Tufted Turtles]]) always go last. As if adjacent 
effects allow the controller to choose the cardinal direction. Clarified kill credit. FAQ Changes 
Removed many superfluous FAQs that are covered directly by the codex. [[Battlemage]] and [[Sea 
Raider]] abilities trigger for each minion they attack and kill, even if multiple minions defend the 
attack, or they get kill credit in other ways during the attack (e.g. [[Flaming Sword]]). [[Seirawan 
Hydra]] is immune to non-lethal damage, as in the keyword. So even a [[Major Explosion]] or a strike 
from [[Great Old One]] isn't enough to kill it. Of course, a single point of damage from [[Pit 
Vipers]] or [[Poison Nova]] will still kill it, or being underwater, underground, etc., and it's 
still vulnerable to [[Mesmerism]], [[Infiltrate]], etc. [[Merlin]]'s ability is clarified to be a 
passive ability, so you can look at your top spell any time on your turn, but you can still only 
cast a spell when it's normally allowed. Typically you can only cast spells during your main phase. 
If a [[Crave Golem]] were attacking during your Start Phase, you could use Merlin's ability to cast 
a [[Dodge Roll]] then. Let me know if you ever do that in a real game! -Ira Clarified that 
[[Awakened Mummies]] cause a fight when they unburrow. Clarified [[Crave Golem]]'s ability. Some 
cards were updated, including: [[Askelon Phoenix]] [[Druid]] [[Updraft Ridge]] [[Archimago]] 
[[Geomancer]] [[Vivien the Enchantress]]"

Conjure and summon are analogous.",""
"Copy","When a card enters the realm as a copy, e.g. [[Mirror Realm]] or [[Selfsame Simulacrum]], its 
characteristics and abilities match the copied card. If the copying card (e.g. Selfsame Simulacrum) 
leaves the realm, it reverts to its printed characteristics and abilities. When you create a copy, 
e.g. an artifact via [[Replication]] or a magic via [[Archimago]] or [[Orb of Ba'al Berith]], the 
characteristics and abilities match the copied card, and the copy is a token. For example, in the 
case of a copied magic, it will be banished as soon as it resolves from the storyline, per the 
normal token rules.",""
"Corner","The corners of the realm are squares 1, 5, 16, and 20.",""
"Cost","Cost is the amount of mana required to cast a spell. Cost can be modified by various effects, e.g. 
[[Hamlet]]. Cost cannot be negative. Sites have a default cost of zero. When determining the cost of 
a spell with an X value (e.g. [[Assorted Animals]]), X is the actual mana cost while the spell is on 
the storyline, and otherwise X is zero. To calculate the total cost of a spell or ability: Start 
with the mana cost or activation cost. For example, (3) for [[Bury]]. Alternately, you can start 
with an alternate cost. For example, (0) if you discard a card for [[Aramos Mercenaries]]. Include 
any additional costs. For example, discarding a site for [[Craterize]]. Add anything that increases 
cost. For example, (2) for [[Maddening Bells]]. Subtract anything that reduces cost. For example, 
(1) less for [[Philosopher's Stone]].",""
"Damage","Cards take damage from fighting and from the effects of spells and abilities. Damage dealt to 
minions accumulates until the end phase, at which time it is healed. Whenever a minion accumulates 
damage equal to or greater than its power, it dies. Damage dealt to your Avatar causes you to lose 
life (or lose the game if they were already at Death's Door). Damage dealt to a site causes the 
player who controls the site to lose life equal to the damage dealt. Damage modification and 
prevention are described in more detail below, and the 'attack' codex entry provides further details 
as well. In most cases, there will be zero or perhaps one damage modifier, and it will be easy to 
determine damage. But in complex cases, follow these steps when applying damage: Determine incoming 
damage. Declare and immediately apply damage modification from the active player, then the 
non-active player. Declare and immediately apply damage prevention effects from the active player, 
then the non-active player. Note that replacement effects and prevention effects don't use the 
storyline, which is why they are immediately applied as soon as they're declared.",""
"","","Modifying Damage:  Damage can be modified in a variety of ways: Reduce damage, e.g. [[Shield 
Maidens]]. Increase damage, e.g. Lance. Double damage, e.g. [[Critical Strike]] Set damage, e.g. 
[[Golden Harp]] Redirect damage, e.g. [[Sir Gawain]] Note that damage prevention effects including 
damage immunity (e.g. [[Tufted Turtles]], [[Lava Salamander]]) are separate and apply after all 
damage modification effects. Damage prevention effects use the word 'prevent' or 'immune;' see the 
Preventing Damage section below for more details. Damage modification effects, including all those 
listed above, are replacement effects and are all handled the same way. Specifically: In the order 
of their choice, the active player declares and immediately resolves all of their damage 
modification effects, including from sources they own and no one controls (e.g. a [[Mask of Mayhem]] 
controlled by no one). Note that replacement effects do not use the storyline, and thus these 
effects are immediately resolved as soon as they are declared. In the order of their choice, the 
non-active player does the same thing. Each replacement effect can only be applied at most once per 
instance of damage. For example, if you have two Sir Gawains (perhaps via [[Selfsame Simulacrum]]), 
each Sir Gawain can redirect to themselves once, but they can't use their ability a second time on 
the same instance of damage. After applying all the damage modification, proceed to damage 
prevention."
"","","Preventing Damage:  Damage prevention uses the words 'prevent' or 'immune,' and applies after all 
other damage modification. Examples include: Prevent damage, e.g. [[Goswhit Helm]]. Immune to 
damage, e.g. [[Lava Salamander]], or an Avatar on the turn they're put to Death's Door. After 
applying all damage modification effects, then apply damage prevention effects in the same way: In 
the order of their choice, the active player declares and immediately resolves all of their damage 
prevention effects, including from sources they own and no one controls. Note that prevention 
effects do not use the storyline, and thus these effects are immediately resolved as soon as they 
are declared. In the order of their choice, the non-active player does the same thing."
"Damage Grid","To simplify rules text and illustrate the extent of effects over a wide area, some cards show a 
damage grid, e.g. [[Craterize]]. Damage grids may use a bold square to indicate the center of the 
card's effect, or a dot to show the Spellcaster's location on the grid, e.g. [[Cone of Flame]]. A 
damage grid may be rotated and reflected, though some effects may specify otherwise. E.g. [[Flame 
Wave]] may only be reflected, not rotated. A damage grid affects each unit at the shown squares and 
in the same region as the caster, though some effects may specify otherwise. E.g. [[Craterize]] 
specifies 'above and below.'  An effect with a damage grid may be oriented so that the grid is 
partially outside the realm, as long as the source or origin square in the realm.",""
"Dead Minion","A dead minion is a minion that's in a cemetery.",""
"Death Blow","A death blow is any damage dealt to an Avatar who is on death's door. If you deal a death blow to 
your opponent's avatar, you win! The damage can come from a strike or any effect that specifically 
deals damage. Note that attacking their sites causes your opponent's avatar to lose life, which is 
different from damaging their avatar. Losing life, including due to site damage, does not cause a 
death blow. If both Avatars suffer a death blow simultaneously (perhaps by one attacking the other), 
the game is a draw. Alternately, many tournaments declare that simultaneous death blows are ignored, 
and the game continues.",""
"Death's Door","As your Avatar loses life, its connection with the realm weakens. When your life is reduced to 0, 
you don't instantly lose the game! Instead, you are at death's door and your life total cannot 
change (e.g. no healing). The moment you reach 0 life, your Avatar becomes immune to damage until 
the end of that turn. After that single turn, any damage dealt to your avatar is a death blow, 
causing you to lose the game. See the 'death blow' codex entry for more details.",""
"Deathrite","Keyword Ability. Deathrite is keyword for a triggered ability with the text: When this card dies, 
... Do whatever is stated. Deathrite effects resolve before placing the card in its owner's 
cemetery. See the '((die))' and '((attack))' codex entries for more details on specific Deathrite 
timing.",""
"Defend","Defend is a basic ability that allows you to defend against your opponent's attacks. A unit must be 
untapped to defend, and it's one of two basic abilities that you can use on your opponent's turn 
(the other is Intercept). Defend is a triggered ability with the following text: When an enemy 
attacks another unit or site in this unit's range of motion, it may tap to defend, moving to the 
attack's location and joining the fight. When an attack is occurring, there is a window to defend. 
See the '((attack))' codex entry for further details. During that window, multiple different units 
can defend, one at a time. When a unit moves to defend, it may use any of its movement abilities, 
such as Airborne, Burrowing, Movement +X, Submerge, or Voidwalk. If the original target of the 
attack was a unit, the defender's controller may decide if that unit remains in the fight, or is 
removed. If the original target was a site, it is automatically removed. Remember, only 'attacks' 
can be defended; attacks are only caused by the Move and Attack basic ability, or very specific card 
text that uses the word 'attack,' e.g. [[Crave Golem]]. When a unit uses its Defend ability, it 
automatically becomes a legal target for the attack. For example, a minion with Stealth normally 
can't be targeted by an attack, but if it chooses to Defend, it will be a legal target (as an 
explicit exception to the normal precedence in the Silver Rule).",""
"","","Movement Paths for Defending:  When a unit defends, it must declare a movement path that ends with 
it occupying the attack's location, ignoring any triggered abilities."
"","","When Exactly is a Unit Allowed to Defend?:  If the unit is untapped and the attack's location is 
within its range of motion. See '((range of motion))' for more details."
"Defender","Defender is the opposite of attacker. Any attacked unit is considered a defender, even if they 
didn't use the Defend ability. A unit that uses the Defend ability becomes a defender, but the 
originally attacked unit is also a 'defender' if it stays in the fight. An attack is 'undefended' 
only if there are no defenders (i.e. attacking a site).",""
"Die","'Dies' is synonymous with 'destroyed' and 'killed' (and 'dispel' for auras). Whenever a minion has 
damage on it equal to or greater than its power (or is destroyed directly by an effect), that card 
is marked for death. After it is marked, any 'kill' or Deathrite triggers resolve, and finally the 
marked card is put into its owner's cemetery. If multiple cards are marked for death simultaneously, 
use the normal storyline rules for simultaneous triggers, then all the marked cards are put into 
their owners' cemeteries simultaneously.
Once a card has been marked for death, nothing can remove the mark. An effect that heals a marked 
creature or increases its power does not remove the mark. Certain replacement effects can avoid 
death entirely (e.g. [[Gilded Aegis]], [[Lady Iseult]]), in which case the minion was never marked 
for death at all, because that's how replacement effects work.
An effect may move a marked card to a different zone (e.g. [[Fey Changeling]] on [[The Geistwood]]), 
but that card is still considered to have died for the purposes of other effects.
If a Deathrite ability causes more cards to die, they are also marked for death, and their Deathrite 
effects will also trigger before any cards are placed in the cemetery. None of the cards that have 
been marked for death are put into their owners' cemeteries until all Deathrite effects have 
resolved.
Players cannot choose to sacrifice or kill a card that is already marked for death. A card that is 
already marked for death cannot be marked for death again, and any effect that attempts to destroy 
or sacrifice that card fails. That card still only triggers its Deathrite ability once.
Cards that are sacrificed also count as being destroyed. They are marked for death following the 
same process outlined above.",""
"Disabled","While disabled, a minion has no abilities (including basic abilities), cannot strike, cannot take 
steps itself, cannot shoot projectiles, and cannot be tapped to pay for costs.
A disabled minion may be moved forcefully as long the disabled minion does not take one of its own 
steps. A disabled minion may still be tapped by effects as long as it isn't tapping to pay for 
costs.
Disabled is not an ability itself and is not removed by silence effects (e.g. [[Silence]]).",""
"Dispel","Dispel means to 'die,' for auras. See the 'die' codex entry for more details.",""
"Drop","Drop is a basic, activated ability with the following text: Once on your turn, if this unit hasn't 
interacted with the realm, it may drop any number of artifacts it's carrying. Each unit can use its 
Drop ability once per turn. Since Drop is an activated ability, you can only use it during the main 
phase on your turn while nothing is on the storyline. For example, you can't use the Drop ability 
while in the middle of the Move and Attack ability. If the unit has the ability to carry other units 
(e.g. [[War Horse]]), then its Drop basic ability is modified from 'artifacts' to 'artifacts and/or 
units.' See the 'Pick Up' and 'Interact' codex entries for more details.",""
"Earth Site","An earth site is a site that provides at least one earth (E) affinity. If the site provides other 
types of affinity as well, it's still an earth site as long as it provides at least one earth 
affinity. In particular, note that a site could be a water site (because it provides water affinity) 
AND an earth site (because it provides earth affinity). [[Aqueduct]] is an example of a water site 
and earth site. Earth site and land site are NOT synonyms.",""
"Element","Sorcery: Contested Realm is built around the four classical elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. 
To cast spells, you'll generally need to have elemental affinity. A spell is an air spell if it 
requires one or more air threshold, e.g. [[Apprentice Wizard]], or has an air frame, e.g. [[Castle 
Servants]]. Earth, fire, and water spells are determined in the same manner. If a spell requires 
multiple different elemental thresholds, e.g. [[Purple Knight]], it is each of those elements. 
Knowing the element of a spell is relevant for cards like [[Lava Salamander]], which can only cast 
fire spells and takes no damage from fire spells. A site is an air site if it provides one or more 
air affinity. Earth, fire, and water sites are determined in the same manner. If a site provides 
multiple different elemental affinities, e.g. [[Ruins]], it is each of those elements. Knowing the 
element of a site is relevant for cards like [[Avatar of Earth]], which specifically looks for earth 
elemental affinity on sites.",""
"","","Air:  Air is the element of knowledge and ))power((, dabbling in forces beyond mortal ))control(( to 
acquire the magical means to respond to any battlefield situation. An attunement with air grants you 
both mobility and tactical options thanks to its ability to teleport units around the realm and to 
increase its available spells."
"","","Earth:  Earth is the element of enduring strength, defined by its focus on fielding and enhancing 
martial forces throughout the realm. An attunement with earth grants you the ability to affect your 
atlas and minions that can dominate the battle through teamwork and sheer ))fighting(( power."
"","","Fire:  Fire is the element of desire and destruction, willing to do whatever it takes to secure 
victory in the realm. An attunement with fire grants you an array of explosive spells and abilities 
that can create bursts of speed or burn friend and foe alike in great gouts of flame."
"","","Water:  Water is the element of charm and trickery, ready to adapt and disrupt the strategies of the 
enemy as it manipulates all. An attunement with water grants you a powerful homefield advantage that 
will slowly engulf the realm and the ability to position the enemy right where you want them."
"Elemental Threshold and Affinity","Elemental threshold, often shortened to simply 'threshold,' describes how much elemental affinity is 
needed to cast most spells or use some abilities. Elemental affinity is most often provided by 
sites, but can come from other sources as well. For example, [[Arid Desert]] provides one fire 
affinity (F), denoted by the red triangle near the bottom right of the card. Similarly, [[Blacksmith 
Family]] is a minion that provides fire affinity. There are four elemental thresholds: Air (A), e.g. 
[[Castle Servants]] Earth (E), e.g. [[Common Cottagers]] Fire (F), e.g. [[Blacksmith Family]] Water 
(W), e.g. [[Fisherman's Family]] Unlike mana, you don't spend your affinity. It is merely a 
requirement you must meet to cast spells and use ability. For example, to cast [[Ancient Dragon]] 
with its three fire threshold (F)(F)(F), you must have three or more fire affinity. Some spells, 
often artifacts, have no threshold requirements to cast.",""
"End Phase","The end phase is the last phase during your turn. Trigger abilities that happen at the end of the 
turn. Players remove all damage from their minions in the realm. Remember that Avatars do not 
automatically heal in the same way as damage is removed from minions; however, you can heal using 
spells and other card effects. Effects that last for your turn now end. Your turn is now over.",""
"Enemy","An enemy is a unit that an opponent controls, including their Avatar. Enemies are always units, 
unless otherwise specified by card text. For example, [[Fade]] uses 'enemy site,' which means 'a 
site an opponent controls.'",""
"Enter","A unit 'enters' a location or site when it is summoned there, or when it moves there from somewhere 
else. 'Somewhere else' means 'a different location' for entering locations, and it means 'a 
different site' for entering sites. The method of movement doesn't matter; it can be any type of 
movement, including the Move and Attack basic ability, effects that cause a unit to 'take a step,' 
teleportation, or other forced movement. The relevant questions are: Was it summoned there, OR Did 
it move there from somewhere else? If either of those are true, then the unit 'entered' that 
location or site. Further notes: If a site is placed under an existing unit, the unit did not enter 
the site. The unit didn't move, and it wasn't just summoned, so it didn't enter. This can happen if 
Rubble was replaced by a site, or it was a voidwalk minion in the void and a site was played there. 
If a non-minion occupies a location or site and then becomes a minion without moving (e.g. 
[[Enchantress]]), the minion did not enter. The minion didn't move and wasn't just summoned. If a 
minion moves between levels of a site (e.g. surface to subsurface, or subsurface to surface), it 
does not enter the site, since it was already occupying the site. (It does enter the specific 
location of surface or subsurface.) For oversized units, they only enter a location or site if they 
didn't previously occupy it. For example:  The [[Mountain Giant]] occupies the four left squares, 
and then takes a step to the east. It enters the two sites in the right column, but it does not 
enter the two sites in the middle column, since it already occupied those sites before the move. See 
the '((Oversized Units))' codex entry for more details.",""
"Errata","Errata means to change a printed card after publication, such that the official rules text on the 
card differs from what's printed on it. Use the errata'd text instead of the printed text. For 
example, [[Truesight Crossbow]] needed errata. As printed, the text 'can target Stealth units' 
doesn't actually solve the primary issue of projectiles hitting units with Stealth, since 
projectiles don't target! Therefore, the printed text is a major thematic miss and wouldn't allow 
the bearer to hit Stealth units with ranged strikes! The Erik's Curiosa team felt like it was worth 
an errata to make that card function as intended. For obvious reasons, as few cards as possible are 
errata'd.",""
"Fight","When units fight, they strike each other. Apply the following sequence to resolve a fight: First 
strikes resolve (e.g. Lance, [[Albespine Pikemen]]). Resolve deathrites and 'kill' effects (and 
'successfully attack' effects if this fight was part of an attack). Place dead minions in 
cemeteries. Normal strikes happen. Resolve deathrites and 'kill' effects (and 'successfully attack' 
effects if this fight was part of an attack). Place dead minions in cemeteries. Whenever a unit is 
striking against multiple other units (for example, if there are multiple defenders), the controller 
decides how the strike damage is distributed. There is still only a single strike from that unit 
(though some of the struck units could be struck for zero damage).",""
"Fire Site","A fire site is a site that provides at least one fire (F) affinity. If the site provides other types 
of affinity as well, it's still a fire site as long as it provides at least one fire affinity.",""
"Fireball","This refers to the actual [[Fireball]] spell! This is relevant for the [[Avatar of Fire]].",""
"Flooded","Keyword ability. A flooded site has a minimum of one water affinity (W). Therefore, it's a water 
site, though it still provides other elemental affinities, if any. For example, if a [[Humble 
Village]] was flooded, it would provide earth (E) affinity and water (W) affinity. It would be a 
water site and an earth site. If an effect 'floods' a site (e.g. [[Geyser]]), that site gains the 
Flooded ability for the stated duration. Since Flooded is an ability, effects that remove abilities 
from sites will also remove Flooded.",""
"Fly","If you fly a unit somewhere, treat the unit as if it had Airborne while crossing borders, e.g. 
[[Avatar of Air]]. Fly is synonymous with 'throw through the air,' e.g. [[Siege Giant]]. For 
example, a unit being moved by ))Avatar(( of Air's ability will be able to cross the border of a 
[[Perilous Bridge]] or [[Great Wall]], and will not take damage from a [[Wall of Brambles]], even if 
it's disabled, silenced, or [[Sky Baron]] is in the realm. Note that this effect is specific to 
crossing borders (and not entering sites), and therefore [[Bottomless Pit]] will still trigger for 
non-Airborne minions moved via ))Avatar(( of Air's ability. If you fly a site somewhere, e.g. 
[[Cloud City]], treat all units occupying the site as if they had Airborne while the site moves.",""
"Foot Soldier Token","A Foot Soldier is a token minion with 1 power. A Foot Soldier is an Ordinary Mortal and an ((earth)) 
minion. For example, [[Common Village]].",""
"Forced Movement","Forced movement is any movement that does not require the unit to take their own step. For example, 
[[Windblast]] is forced movement, since the moved unit doesn't step. A unit being carried by another 
unit, e.g. [[War Horse]], is also forced movement for the carried unit. Effects that use the words 
drag, pull, or push are also forced movement, e.g. [[Unland Eel]] or [[Grapple Shot]]. Teleportation 
is forced movement. Effects that require a unit to take a step are not forced movement. For example, 
[[Led Astray]] is not forced movement, because the unit is taking their own step (and an Immobile 
unit wouldn't move at all). Confusingly, some lure effects on older cards use a phrase like 'force 
an enemy to take a step towards,' e.g. [[Coy Nixie]]. This is still not forced movement, since the 
unit is taking their own step, and an Immobile unit wouldn't move; 'force' in these cases is being 
used in the normal English usage. The guiding principle for forced movement is whether or not the 
unit is taking their own step. If they aren't taking their own step, then it's forced movement!",""
"Forward","'Forward' is the cardinal direction away from your starting edge. This is relevant for a few cards 
like [[Dalcean Phalanx]]. 'Forward' is player-relative. If the control of such a card changes, the 
direction it perceives as 'forward' will also change.",""
"Frog Token","A Frog is a token minion with zero power. A Frog is an Ordinary Beast with 'Submerge.' A Frog is a 
((water)) minion. For example, [[Pollimorph]].",""
"Genesis","Keyword Ability. Genesis is keyword for a triggered ability with the text: When this card enters the 
realm, ... Do whatever is stated.",""
"Hand","Your hand contains spells and sites. There is no limit to the number of cards you may have in your 
hand, and their order is irrelevant. You may look at cards in your hand at any time. Your opponent 
is allowed to know how many cards of each type (spell or site) you have in your hand at any time. 
For clarity of game state, if you are using card sleeves, you should use different sleeves for sites 
and spells. Your hand is one of the zones in the game.",""
"Healing","Healing an avatar is synonymous with gaining life. Healing a minion removes damage from that minion. 
When 'you heal X,' you increase your life by that amount, up to your avatar's maximum life. For 
example, [[Divine Healing]] increases your current life by 7 (to a maximum of 20 or whatever your 
avatar's maximum life is). If you are at death's door, your life total can't change, so any healing 
effect will fail. Setting life doesn't count as healing (e.g. [[Twist of Fate]]). But, if you're at 
death's door, your life total can't change and will remain at 0.",""
"Here","'Here' refers to the location(s) that the card occupies. For most cards, such as minions and 
artifacts, that means one location. For example, [[Fey Changeling]]. For auras, that usually means 4 
locations, most commonly the surface of 4 sites. For example, [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]. Another 
example is the use of 'here' on [[Evil Presence]], which includes the site surfaces but could also 
include void squares as well, if the aura occupied a void square. When a site itself uses the word 
'here,' that includes both the site's surface location and it's subsurface location. For example, 
[[Dome of Osiros]] protects minions in its subsurface as well as surface. 'Here' is analogous to 
'there.'",""
"Immobile","Keyword ability. An Immobile unit cannot take steps. For example, if you use the Move and Attack 
basic ability, an Immobile unit can't take steps, though it can still attack and defend at that 
location. An Immobile unit couldn't take any steps with [[Leap Attack]] but it could still strike. 
Forced movement effects apply normally to Immobile units, so they can [[Blink]] or [[Grapple Shot]] 
like any other unit.",""
"Interact","A unit 'interacts' with the realm if it does any of the following things: Strikes Casts a spell 
Activates a special ability Note that only ((activated abilities)) can be activated. Triggered 
abilities and passive abilities aren't activated. Note that a '((special ability))' is different 
from a '((basic ability))'. Deal damage (even if the damage is prevented) Note that 'deal damage' is 
mostly but not fully covered by the first three bullet points. 'Activates a special ability' doesn't 
include triggered abilities, since only activated abilities can be activated. There are some 
triggered abilities that could deal damage, e.g. [[Infernal Legion]] or [[Colicky Dragonettes]], 
which are intentionally included in 'interacting.'",""
"Intercept","Intercept is a basic ability that allows you to fight your opponent's units who 'Move and Attack' 
without actually attacking. A unit must be untapped to intercept, and it's one of two basic 
abilities that you can use on your opponent's turn (the other is Defend). Intercept is a triggered 
ability with the following text: When an enemy using its Move and Attack ability finishes its 
movement and does not attack, any of your units there may tap to intercept and fight that enemy. 
Units cannot move when they intercept; they must already be at the enemy's final location. The 
timing for an attack and the timing for intercept are the same; if the enemy attacks, you may 
defend. If the enemy doesn't attack, you may intercept. In summary, if both of the following are 
true, you can intercept: The enemy used Move and Attack, AND They chose not attack. Units with 
Stealth cannot be intercepted, and units with Airborne can only be intercepted by enemies with 
Airborne or Ranged. If multiple allied units intercept the same enemy, they all fight that enemy 
together. Only the enemy's final location is relevant for interception. See the examples below for 
more details.",""
"","","Intercept as a Deterrent:   I have an [[Apprentice Wizard]] on site D. You have an untapped [[Bosk 
Troll]] on site C, and both [[Queen of Midland]] and [[Queen Guinevere]] on site B. I would love to 
cast my [[Poison Nova]] to kill all your minions, but I need to get my Apprentice Wizard to site C 
first. If I use the Move and Attack ability to move my Apprentice Wizard to site C and then attack, 
your Bosk Troll will be able to defend. If I move to site C but don't attack, your Bosk Troll will 
be able to intercept. Either way, my Apprentice Wizard would die before being able to cast the 
Poison Nova on site C. In the end, I will probably not choose to move to site C, and instead do 
something else. Intercept is a deterrent to certain basic movement, even if you don't actually use 
the intercept ability during a game."
"","","Intercept vs. Movement +X:   You have [[Rimland Nomads]] on site D. I have an untapped [[Bosk

site A Rimland Nomads have Movement +1, so you resolve that movement normally and they're now on the 
surface of site A, having moved past the Bosk Troll without any problem. On the surface of site A, 
they choose not to attack. (If they did attack, my Bosk Troll could defend, killing them.) Even

attack, my Bosk Troll could defend, killing them.) Even though your Foot Soldier departed a location 
shared with my Bosk Troll and then didn't attack, my Bosk Troll cannot intercept now since it 
doesn't share the final location (surface of site A) with your Foot Soldier. Remember, the two 
things that are relevant for intercept are: Did the enemy use the Move and Attack ability, AND Did 
they not attack? At the moment they choose not to attack, that's the moment you can tap to 
intercept, at that location."
"","","Only 'Move and Attack' can Trigger Intercept:   You have an [[Apprentice Wizard]] on site D. I have 
an untapped [[Bosk Troll]] on site C. You cast [[Blink]] to teleport your Wizard to site C. My Bosk 
Troll cannot intercept since you didn't Move and Attack. I can only intercept if you use Move and 
Attack, then don't attack."
"","","Intercept Without Moving:  Units can technically tap to use their Move and Attack ability without 
moving and without attacking since both are optional, perhaps anticipating [[Mesmerism]]. If the 
unit does not attack, you may intercept! For example, you have untapped [[Amazon Warriors]] and I 
have an [[Autumn Unicorn]] at the same location. If I tap my [[Autumn Unicorn]] to use its Move and 
Attack basic ability, then decline to move and decline to attack, your Amazon Warriors may tap to 
Intercept."
"Its Location","If minion, artifact, aura, or avatar refers to 'its location,' that means the location that it 
currently occupies. See the 'here' codex entry for more details.",""
"Its Site","If minion, artifact, aura, or avatar refers to 'its site,' that means the site that it currently 
occupies. See the 'here' codex entry for more details.",""
"Keyword Ability","A keyword is a word or phrase that functions as shorthand for a longer piece of rules text. For 
example, Burrowing is a keyword that includes multiple related rules and abilities (e.g. can move 
between surface and underground locations, and can survive underground). Keywords are used to 
communicate concepts that require more text than what will fit on a card. You can find these longer 
explanations in the rulebook and the Codex. If a card gains multiple copies of a keyword ability, 
usually there is no benefit. For example, a [[Plumed Pegasus]] with Airborne and [[Power of Flight]] 
simply has Airborne. When the Power of Flight ends, the Pegasus will still have Airborne due to its 
printed ability. Sometimes, multiple copies of a keyword do provide a benefit, such as multiple 
Lance keywords, e.g. [[Thankless Squire]].",""
"Kill","Kill simply means destroy; they are synonyms. See 'kill credit' for more details.",""
"Kill Credit","Some effects care about who did the killing (e.g. [[Crown of the Victor]]). Only units can get 
credit for a kill. Determine credit for a kill when a minion dies (i.e. marked for death), in 
priority order (highest first): Did a unit just strike or deal damage with a special ability? Did a 
unit just resolve a Magic spell they cast? Did a unit just activate or trigger an ability, including 
abilities granted by artifacts? If any of the above are true, in priority order, then that unit is 
the killer. If a unit is tapped to pay for an ability (e.g. [[Payload Trebuchet]]), they count as 
'activating' the artifact's ability for purposes of kill credit. The killer must be a unit, but 
multiple units can share credit for a kill, if they both share the same priority. For example, 
[[Grapple Shot]] will only give credit to the ally who strikes, not the spellcaster, since priority 
1 is higher. If two units defend against a single attack, both defenders could get credit for the 
kill. Note that passive abilities and other ongoing effects are not included in kill credit. Only 
activated and triggered abilities are included at priority 3.",""
"Lance","Keyword Ability. A minion with the Lance keyword enters the realm carrying a Lance artifact token. A 
Lance is an Ordinary, Weapon, artifact token with the text: Bearer's next strike deals +1 damage and 
strikes first, then Lance breaks.  Further notes: There's only one 'first strike' window in a fight. 
More than one Lance confers no extra speed benefit. If a unit has multiple Lances, they will each 
add +1 damage, and all will break after the next strike. Using a Lance is not optional. If a unit is 
carrying a Lance and strikes, the Lance will be used and break. Lances are normal artifacts that can 
be picked up and dropped as usual. When they break, they are removed from the game, like all tokens. 
Since the Lance keyword is an 'enters the realm' effect, even if the minion is immediately disabled 
or silenced when entering the realm, they will still have their Lance with them!",""
"Land Site","A land site is a site that provides zero water affinity. Though water sites are tied specifically to 
the element of water, land sites can have any combination of non-water affinity, or no affinity at 
all. For example, a site that provides both fire and air affinity is a land site. A site that 
provides no affinity is also a land site. A land site is not specifically tied to the element of 
earth. If a site provides water affinity and other types of affinity (e.g. earth), it's a water site 
and not a land site. If a site gains water affinity, then it stops being a land site. 'Land site' 
and 'water site' are mutually exclusive. A site cannot be both a water site and a land site; it will 
always be one or the other.",""
"Landbound","Keyword Ability. This minion is disabled while not occupying at least one land location. The 
landbound ability persists even when disabled.",""
"Lethal","Keyword Ability. Any damage a Lethal unit deals to a minion is enough to kill it. (Remember that 
zero damage isn't damage at all, so it will need to do one or more damage.) For example, [[Pit 
Vipers]] can kill [[Amazon Warriors]] with a single strike for 1 damage. If the Amazon Warriors had 
their [[Shield Maidens]] nearby, then the Pit Vipers wouldn't actually kill the Amazon Warriors, 
because they'd do zero damage, which isn't actually damage at all.",""
"Life","Avatars have life. Life represents the amount of damage that your Avatar can endure before it is 
placed on death's door. As your Avatar takes damage, its overall life decreases accordingly. An 
avatar's maximum life is the value printed on their card (typically 20), and cannot exceed that 
number. An avatar's minimum life is zero, and cannot go below that. When an avatar reaches zero 
life, it is on Death's Door.",""
"Location","The smallest area in Sorcery. A location is defined by its square AND region. For example, a square 
with a void has a single location, that particular void location. At the beginning of the game, 
there are 20 locations in the realm, all void. A square with a site has two locations: the surface 
of the site and the subsurface of the site. Those are two different locations, even though they're 
in the same square. If the entire 5x4 realm was filled with sites, then the realm would contain 40 
locations (the surface and subsurface of each of the 20 sites).",""
"Lose","Some effects will cause artifacts, minions, and sites to lose certain abilities, often keywords. 
'Lose' really means 'lose, can't gain, and can't have.' These effects take precedence over competing 
passive abilities. E.g. [[Sky Baron]] wins, even if I give [[Wings of Invention]] to my minion after 
you summoned Sky Baron. It's relevant to these cards: [[Sisters of Silence]], [[Silence]], 
[[Entangle Terrain]], [[Sky Baron]], [[Atlantean Fate]], [[Scent Hounds]], [[House of Ondaros]], 
[[Master Tracker]], [[Magnetic Muzzle]], [[Smokestacks of Gnaak]], [[Watchtower]], [[Hunting 
Party]], [[Sir Bors the Younger]], [[Pebbled Paths]] See the 'Can vs. Can't' codex entry for more 
details.",""
"Magic","Magics are transient spells that have an immediate impact but do not persist in the realm. [[Heat 
Ray]] is an example of a magic. Magics have characteristics, specifically ((magic characteristics)), 
and are one of the six card types in the game. The '((Casting Magics))' entry has details on how to 
cast magic spells.",""
"Main Phase","The main phase is where most of Sorcery's actions and events take place. During this phase, your 
units can be ordered to do two types of actions. They can: Cast a spell from your hand if they are a 
Spellcaster, or Activate one of their abilities You may have your units do these as many times as 
you have resources to do so, and in any order you like. For example, you might have one minion use 
their Move and Attack basic ability, then cast a spell with your Avatar, then have a minion use 
their Pick Up basic ability, then have a different minion use their Move and Attack ability.",""
"Mana","Mana can come from several sources, but sites are the most common. When a mana source enters the 
realm on your turn, and during your start phase, they generate mana. You use this mana to cast 
spells or activate abilities. At the end of your turn, any remaining mana is lost, whether or not 
you used it that turn. You may not generate mana on your opponent's turn.",""
"Mandatory Actions","One game rule causes a mandatory action: If your Avatar is in the void, you may and must use their 
ability to play a site under them, ignoring normal site adjacency rules. Other effects may cause 
mandatory actions (e.g. [[Mask of Mayhem]] or [[The Green Knight]]). For mandatory attacks, the 
question of whether a unit 'can attack,' depends on their range of motion. You must resolve 
mandatory actions during your main phase before doing anything else. If you have multiple mandatory 
actions, do one of your choice, resolve it, and then continue doing mandatory actions one at a time 
until they are all resolved. To properly apply mandatory actions, simply ask: At this moment in my 
main phase, can I do the mandatory action? If yes, do it now! If no, do whatever you wish. If there 
is a mandatory action that you can't legally take, you can proceed with your main phase as you wish. 
If at any point during your main phase you become able to take a mandatory action, you must do so 
immediately, before continuing. Example - Avatar in the Void with No Sites in Hand
Your Avatar is in the void, so the game rules require you to play a site under your Avatar, ignoring 
normal site adjacency rules. But, you don't have any sites in your hand, so you can't. Therefore, 
you are free to continue your main phase as you wish. You are not required to draw a site at the 
start of your turn, nor tap your Avatar to draw a site. But if at any point you have a site in hand 
and an untapped Avatar in the void, you must play a site under you!  Example - Mandatory Attack Your 
[[Bosk Troll]] is 2 squares away from [[The Green Knight]], The Green Knight is not within the Bosk 
Troll's range of motion, and thus you are not required to attack The Green Knight. You take actions 
in your main phase as you wish. Perhaps you cast a [[War Horse]] in the same square as the Bosk 
Troll. Then, you have the [[War Horse]] use the Pick Up basic ability, carrying the Bosk Troll. 
Then, you use the War Horse's Move and Attack basic ability, moving one square closer to The Green 
Knight. After resolving the War Horse's ability and the storyline is empty, the Bosk Troll is now 
able to attack The Green Knight. You must do so, in the middle of your main phase before doing 
anything else. You were not required to carry the Bosk Troll closer to The Green Knight. But once 
you chose to do that, the game noticed that The Green Knight was in the Bosk Troll's range of 
motion, and thus you were required to make the Troll's attack.",""
"Materials Needed to Play Sorcery","A deck, a way to track life, and a fun attitude! A playmat will also help, but it's not strictly 
required! Your deck includes 1 avatar, a spellbook, and an atlas. Depending on the format 
(constructed vs. draft/sealed), the minimum deck size varies, so explore those codex entries for 
more details.",""
"May and Can","If an effect uses the word 'may' or 'can,' it is optional, e.g. [[Aramos Mercenaries]] or [[Felbog 
Frog Men]]. Exception: if the effect uses 'may only' or 'can only,' then it's actually a mandatory 
restriction, e.g. [[Dalcean Phalanx]] or [[Morgana le Fay]].",""
"Minion","Minions are your greatest allies, assisting you with myriad abilities in offense and defense. 
[[Plumed Pegasus]] is an example of a minion. Minions have characteristics, specifically ((minion 
characteristics)), and are one of the six card types in the game. The '((Casting Minions))' entry 
has details on how to cast minion spells.",""
"Move","'Move' means to go from one location in the realm to a different location in the realm. There are 
many ways for units in Sorcery to move. The most common way for a unit to move is the Move and 
Attack basic ability. Another way for a unit to move is a forced movement effect, including 
teleportation. Notably, if a unit enters a location from a different zone, e.g. summoning a minion 
from your hand, cemetery, or spellbook, that does not count as moving (though it is 'entering'). 
Finally, note that if a unit tries to 'move' from its current location to that same location, it's 
not actually moving at all.",""
"Move and Attack","Move and Attack is a basic, activated ability with the following text: Tap -> This unit may take one 
step. Then, it may attack.",""
"","","Movement:  Normally the unit's movement path is one step between two adjacent surface locations, but 
some abilities may modify this, including Movement +X, Moves Freely, Burrowing, Submerge, Airborne, 
and Voidwalk (and effects like [[Felbog Frog Men]]). Steps resolve one at a time. Because some 
abilities may change as your unit moves through the realm, you may declare seemingly-illegal 
movement paths. That is, the legality of the movement path is only checked step by step, as each 
individual step is about to happen. If the step is not legal at the moment you try to take it, you 
do not take that step, and you continue resolving anything remaining. See the examples below for 
further details. When you declare movement, the only restriction is that you may not repeat specific 
steps. If your unit takes at least one step, it has moved; if it takes zero steps, it has not moved."
"","","Declaring The Attack Target:  The Move and Attack ability does not use the word 'target,' so you do 
not declare any targets in advance. As it resolves from the storyline, you declare your full 
movement path, then resolve that movement. After completing all the movement (if any), you may 
attack, declaring your attack target at that time. See the '((attack))' codex entry for further 
details on the attack sequence."
"","","Example - Declaring a Seemingly Illegal Movement Path:   [[Rimland Nomads]] are at A, in a 
[[Silence]] aura on the leftmost 2x2 area. You use their Move and Attack basic ability and declare 
the following movement path: Surface A -> Surface B Surface B -> Surface C Since the Nomads are in a 
Silence aura, they do not currently have Movement +1 and therefore they wouldn't normally be able to 
take two steps. Nonetheless, you can declare the path and see what happens. Once they step onto B, 
they're out of the aura. The game tries to resolve the second step and notices that, yes, the Nomads 
do have the capacity to take a second step, so they do, and end up at C."
"Movement +X","Keyword Ability. A unit with Movement +X may move up to X additional steps when using the Move and 
Attack or Defend basic abilities. For example, [[Rimland Nomads]] may take two steps instead of just 
one. If a unit has multiple copies of the Movement +X ability, the numbers simply add together. For 
example, [[Rimland Nomads]] with [[Mad Dash]] have Movement +2.",""
"Moves Freely","A unit with Moves Freely spends no steps moving via the Move and Attack or Defend basic abilities, 
as long as the starting and ending locations of the step satisfy the Moves Freely condition. Moves 
Freely only applies to basic movement, which is movement from the Move and Attack basic ability and 
the Defend basic ability. A unit can combine free steps with regular steps, up to its movement 
limit. See the examples below for more details.",""
"","","Examples of Moves Freely:  Example 1  w1, w2, and w3 are water sites. A and B are land sites. [[Sir 
Pelleas]] starts underwater at w1. He can take 1 step normally with the Move and Attack ability, so 
he declares the following movement path: w1 underwater -> w1 surface (0 steps, Moves Freely between 
water locations) w1 surface -> w2 surface (still 0 steps) w2 surface -> A surface (1 step) Note that 
[[Sir Pelleas]] cannot simply teleport to w3; Moves Freely requires the unit to declare a movement 
path, and some of the steps in that path might be free.  Example 2 Same as above, but [[Sir 
Pelleas]] starts on the surface of B. He can declare this path: B surface -> w1 surface (1 step) w1 
surface -> w1 underwater (0 steps) w1 underwater -> w2 underwater (0 steps) w2 underwater -> w2 
surface (0 steps) The last three steps are all free, because they are between two water locations, 
per the Moves Freely ability of [[Sir Pelleas]]. Note that [[Sir Pelleas]] couldn't then continue 
from w2 surface to A surface, because that's not a free step, and [[Sir Pelleas]] already used up 
his 1 step for his Move and Attack basic ability."
"Near","Near is a synonym for 'nearby.'",""
"Nearby","Nearby refers to the current square and the eight squares that surround it (including diagonals). 
For example, the middle square has 9 nearby squares - itself and eight others.  If a square is in 
the corner of the realm, it will have fewer nearby squares. For example, the bottom right square has 
only 4 nearby squares - itself and three others.  When referring to nearby sites, nearby voids, or 
nearby squares the effect can cross the boundaries of regions. For example, [[Ultimate Horror]] can 
be in the void and still summon to a nearby site, even though sites and voids are in different 
regions. For all other references to nearby, such as nearby locations, nearby minions, nearby 
artifact, etc., regional boundaries must be respected and cannot be crossed. For example, if 
[[Belfry]] is on a site, it will not untap allies in a nearby void, because 'nearby ally' cannot 
cross a regional boundary.",""
"Non-Active Player","The non-active player is the player who is not currently taking their turn.",""
"On the Ground","To move 'on the ground' means to start from the surface of a site and move to another site's 
surface, excluding Airborne and teleport. This includes all types of sites, including water sites.",""
"Ongoing Effect","Ongoing effects apply continuously during their duration. If they do not have a listed duration, 
they apply indefinitely while the source is in the realm. For example, [[King of the Realm]]'s 
passive ability is an ongoing effect that gives you control of all mortals. [[Gnome Hollows]]' 
passive ability is an ongoing effect that prevents units with 3 or more power from entering. 
[[Quagmire]]'s genesis ability creates an ongoing effect that causes units to be Immobile while they 
occupy nearby sites until your next turn. Between each event on the storyline, apply all ongoing 
effects. That is, the game is very regularly applying ongoing effects, both before and after each 
event on the storyline. Most of the time, the application of ongoing effects is straightforward; 
simply apply them. Complex interactions are described below.",""
"","","Apply All Ongoing Effects Before Checking For Minions Dying:  If there are multiple ongoing effects, 
the game will apply all of them before checking to see if any minions died. For example, you have a 
[[Bosk Troll]] that has taken 1 damage this turn. Then, you move it to a location that is nearby 
both [[Wicked Witch]] and your [[House Arn Bannerman]]. Both the Witch and the Bannerman generate 
ongoing effects with their passive abilities. If the game applied the -2 power from the Witch first 
and then immediately checked for minions dying, the Bosk Troll would die, even though it shouldn't 
due to the House Arn Bannerman. Therefore, between each event on the storyline, the game applies all 
ongoing effects before checking for minions dying."
"","","Apply Ongoing Effects In Order:  If ongoing effects overlap or conflict, apply them in the order 
listed here by layer: Copy effects, e.g. [[Mirror Realm]], [[Selfsame Simulacrum]] Disabling 
effects, silencing effects, e.g. [[Root Spider]], [[Iron Shackles]], [[Silence]], [[Sisters of 
Silence]] Control effects, e.g. [[King of the Realm]], [[Mesmerism]] Type changing effects, e.g. 
[[Bower of Bliss]], [[Island Leviathan]] Ability adding and removing effects, and affinity changing 
effects, e.g. [[Power of Flight]], [[Watchtower]], [[Tide Naiads]], [[Drought]] Power setting 
effects, e.g. [[Shrink]] Power addition and subtraction effects, e.g. [[Overpower]], [[Wicked 
Witch]] Power multiplication effects, e.g. [[Warp Spasm]] Within each layer, apply the effects based 
on their timestamp, from oldest to newest. For ongoing effects generated by a passive ability (e.g. 
[[King of the Realm]], [[Root Spider]]), their timestamp is when the card entered the realm. For 
ongoing effects generated by an activated or triggered ability (e.g. [[Floodplain]], [[Bog]]), their 
timestamp is when the ability was activated or triggered, not when the original source entered the 
realm. An effect cannot remove itself once it's already being applied. For example, an animated 
[[Silence]] aura will cause itself to lose its abilities in layer 2, but losing that ability will 
not remove the silence effect, which was already being applied."
"","","Example - Two Kings of the Realm:  If you play [[King of the Realm]] and then I play [[King of the 
Realm]] afterward, the game applies both control effects in layer 3. Since your King is older, the 
game starts with that effect. Your King gives you control of all mortals, including my King. Then, 
when the second King's ability is being applied, he's already controlled by you due to the first 
King's ability. Therefore, you control all mortals and the first King 'wins.'"
"","","Example - Two Smokestacks of Gnaak:  If you play [[Smokestacks of Gnaak]] and then I play another 
Smokestacks of Gnaak nearby, the game tries to apply both lose-ability effects in layer 5. Since 
your Smokestacks are older, the game starts with that effect. Your Smokestacks causes my Smokestacks 
to lose its ability. Then, when my Smokestacks ability would be applied, it already lost its ability 
due to the first Smokestacks. Therefore, the first Smokestacks 'wins.'"
"","","Example - Flood vs. Drought:  If you play [[Flood]] and then I play [[Drought]], the game tries to 
apply both affinity changing effects in layer 5. Since you played Flood first, the game first gives 
the affected sites a minimum of one water affinity (W). Then, when my Drought ability is applied, 
the affected sites have no water affinity. Therefore, the Drought 'wins.' If Flood had been played 
second, then the Flood effect would have been applied second, and thus would 'win.' Remember that if 
an activated or triggered ability creates an ongoing effect, the effect applies based on when the 
ability activated or triggered, not when the original source entered the realm. For example, 
[[Floodplain]]'s activated ability would 'win' against a [[Drought]] even if the Floodplain entered 
the realm before Drought, as long as the Floodplain's activated ability was used after Drought."
"Oversized Units","Normally, units occupy only one location while in the realm. However, some oversized units occupy 
multiple locations simultaneously due to their size, e.g. [[Mountain Giant]]. To represent the 
minion's locations, place the card at the intersection of the sites. When you cast such a minion, 
declare the area it will occupy when summoned, which must include at least one of your sites, per 
normal minion casting rules. It may include some of your opponent's sites, but couldn't include the 
void (without Voidwalk) nor [[Gnome Hollows]] (unless its power was low enough). A card's size is 
determined as it enters the realm and becomes one of its characteristics. Therefore, even if a 
[[Mountain Giant]] were disabled or in a [[Silence]] aura, it would continue to occupy a 2x2 area. 
Exception: Some effects modify a unit's size after it's in the realm, e.g. [[Megamoeba]], and those 
size-modifying effects could be removed later (e.g. disabled, [[Silence]]). Oversized units occupy 
each of their locations. Therefore, if grid damage is dealt to multiple such locations, oversized 
units take damage at each of those locations. For example, a [[Major Explosion]] centered on a 
Mountain Giant would deal 7 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 20 damage to it. An oversized unit could simultaneously 
occupy both land and water sites, as well as void squares if it had voidwalk. It cannot occupy the 
surface and subsurface simultaneously, unless it has specific text allowing it, e.g. [[Megamoeba]]. 
When an oversized unit moves, you choose a direction and all parts of it move that direction. If any 
part of it can't move in the chosen direction, then it can't move in that direction at all. When 
attacking, oversized units still target only a single enemy unit or site.",""
"","","Teleporting Oversized Units:  When an oversized unit is teleported, it must be to a location or set 
of locations that are all legal for that unit to occupy, and must not cross regional boundaries 
unless allowed by card text. If the destination of the teleportation is a single location, the 
controller of the teleportation effect chooses the position and orientation of the unit, as long as 
the destination is included in the locations it ends up occupying. For example, [[Mountain Giant]] 
is chosen as the ally for [[Blink]]:  As the 'nearby location,' I choose X. Now, the Mountain Giant 
can end up in any of these positions:     Since the Mountain Giant is a square shape, its 
orientation doesn't typically matter, but if it were carrying something, it could also be rotated as 
desired from the teleportation."
"","","Cards that Assume Units Occupy Only One Location:  There are many cards that assume units occupy 
only one location or site. When resolving such effects for oversized units, simply pick a single 
site or location they occupy. For example, [[Spin Attack]], [[Leap Attack]], and [[Recall]] all 
assume the unit occupies only one location; to resolve them properly, you pick one location the 
oversized unit occupies."
"Ownership and Control","You are the owner of all the cards you bring to a game of Sorcery. The owner of a card does not 
change during the game. A card is always returned to its owner's hand, shuffled into its owner's 
deck, or sent to its owner's cemetery, regardless of who controls the card when it leaves the realm. 
While the owner of a card is most often its controller, control of cards may change over the course 
of a game, e.g. [[Mesmerism]]. When effects use phrases like 'your minions' or 'your sites,' it 
refers to what you control, and not what you own. By default, cards are controlled by whoever puts 
them into the realm. For artifacts that can be carried, the controller of the unit that's carrying 
the artifact also controls the artifact itself. If such an artifact is not carried, it has no 
controller. For tokens, see the '((Token))' codex entry for details.",""
"Passive Ability","A passive ability creates an ongoing effect that is always active while the card is in the relevant 
game zone. Typically this zone will be the realm, but some cards have abilities that specify what 
they do while in your hand, while in your cemetery, etc. [[King of the Realm]] is an example of a 
card with a passive ability. A passive ability is one of the few ways that an ongoing effect can be 
created. See the '((ongoing effect))' codex entry for more details on how to handle multiple 
overlapping or conflicting ongoing effects.",""
"Path","A path for a card that's moving involves 1 or more steps, and each step has a starting and ending 
location that's different. If your step is from a location to that same location, you didn't 
actually move anywhere. If you occupied multiple locations while moving, all of those locations are 
included in your path, including for oversized units. A path for projectiles is a bit different, and 
can include just the starting location. See '((projectiles))' for more details.",""
"Phrases that are Synonymous","Sorcery cards use natural, thematic language. Some words and phrases are synonymous and have the 
same game effect: Fly. Throw through the air.  You heal. Gain life. Technically, if a minion heals, 
its wounds can go away. If a minion gains life, there's no effect. But there are very few cards in 
the game that ever heal minions, e.g. [[Font of Life]]. The vast majority of healing effects only 
heal 'you,' the player.  Drag. Pull. Note that 'Lure' is different, since 'Lure' requires the unit 
to take the step themselves.  Destroy. Kill. Die. Dispel (for auras). Note that 'Banish' is 
different from those listed above.  Traverse. Move into. Enter. Leave. Note that 'leave' and 'enter' 
obviously care about different locations, but the moment in time is identical. If you move and leave 
one location, you have simultaneously entered a different location. There's no moment when you're in 
limbo between locations.  Atop. Above.  Near. Nearby.  On the ground. Onto the ground.",""
"Phrases with Subtle Meanings","Sorcery cards use natural, thematic language. Some words and phrases have different meanings 
depending on their context. Read the card text carefully to determine which meaning is correct: 
Bottom (deck) vs. Bottom (realm)  Surface (noun) vs. Surface (verb)  Aboveground (atop, includes 
Airborne) vs. 'on the ground' (related to movement from surface to surface, excludes Airborne) These 
two phrases mean different things!  Water (threshold) vs. Water site (opposite of land site) These 
are very similar ideas, but not exactly the same.  Fight vs. Attack vs. Strike If a card uses the 
word fight, it ignores normal attack targeting restrictions. E.g. [[Pudge Butcher]] could fight 
[[Gyre Hippogriffs]] even though they have Airborne and Pudge Butcher does not, and [[Giant Shark]] 
could fight a [[Band of Thieves]] that moves in the water even though the Thieves have Stealth. All 
units involved in the fight strike each other simultaneously. If a card uses the word strike, it 
also ignores normal attack targeting restrictions. E.g. [[Grapple Shot]] can allow a [[Bosk Troll]] 
to strike Gyre Hippogriffs even though they have Airborne and the Troll does not. When a unit 
strikes due to an effect like Grapple Shot (and not merely a fight), the opposing unit doesn't 
strike back. If a card uses the word attack in the text, follow normal attack restrictions and card 
effects, e.g. [[Crave Golem]], which has many FAQs to clarify the effect! Note that some cards use 
'attack' in the title (e.g. [[Spin Attack]]) but use 'strike' in the card text; card text is what 
matters in this case, not the title.  Take a step vs. X steps away vs. Push/Pull one step See the 
'Step' codex entry for more details.  Stops is not the same as at rest. A unit stops when there is 
no additional movement for that unit on the storyline. A unit must first move to then stop. At rest 
means nothing is on the storyline. See the 'At Rest' codex entry for more details.  Draw vs. 'Put 
into your hand' If you put a card directly into your hand, you have not drawn it.",""
"Pick Up","Pick Up is a basic, activated ability with the following text: Once on your turn, this unit may pick 
up any number of artifacts here. Each unit can use its Pick Up ability once per turn. Since Pick Up 
is an activated ability, you can only use it during the main phase on your turn while nothing is on 
the storyline. For example, you can't use the Pick Up ability while in the middle of the Move and 
Attack ability. If the unit has the ability to carry units (e.g. [[War Horse]]), then its Pick Up 
basic ability is modified from 'artifacts' to 'artifacts and/or units.' See the 'Drop' and 
'((Carrying Units))' codex entries for more details.",""
"Play","The word 'play' is synonymous with 'cast' for purposes of spells. For sites, the word 'play' means 
selecting the site and placing it in the realm. Unlike spells that enter the storyline, playing 
sites does not use the storyline. They go directly from your hand (or your atlas) to the realm.",""
"Power","Units have power, which is a measure of their ability to inflict damage and sustain damage. Power is 
most often shown as a single number in the top right of the card. For example, [[Bosk Troll]] has a 
power of 3. When it strikes, it will inflict 3 damage. If it takes 3 or more damage in a turn, it 
will die. Some minions have split power. Units may not have less than zero power. See the '((zero))' 
codex entry for more details on units with zero power.",""
"Prevention Effect","Prevention effects are very similar to replacement effects, but are specifically related to 
preventing damage, and apply after replacement effects. For example, [[Tufted Turtle]] is a 
prevention effect. When applying damage to a Tufted Turtle, first apply any replacement effects 
(e.g. Lance, [[Critical Strike]]) and then apply the Turtle's prevention effect last. This rule 
ensures that prevention effects function properly. E.g., you can't somehow apply a Lance after the 
Turtle's prevention effect was applied, somehow dealing damage, which would be wrong. For more 
details, see the 'Damage' codex entry and subsections.",""
"Printed Ability","Printed abilities are the special abilities actually printed on the card. Any special abilities that 
the card gains through other effects, while still special abilities, are not 'printed' abilities.",""
"Projectile","A projectile's flight begins at the shooting unit's location and travels within the same region in a 
cardinal direction. Its flight continues until it either reaches the edge of its region or it 
reaches the first unit (enemy or ally) along its path, ignoring any allies at the projectile's 
starting location. Different projectiles will have different effects, but often deal damage to the 
impacted unit. If there are multiple valid units that could be hit, the projectile's controller 
chooses which unit the projectile hits. Projectiles enter their starting location. Then, they have a 
path that includes their starting location and any additional locations. Projectiles cannot hit 
minions with Stealth, but some projectiles don't care about 'hitting' and instead just care about 
their path (e.g. [[Snowball]]).",""
"","","Piercing Projectile:  Piercing projectiles keep moving even after hitting a unit; they only stop 
when they reach a region boundary. Piercing projectiles only hit one unit at each location, ignoring 
allies at the starting location as usual. A piercing projectile cannot cross region boundaries, and 
cannot hit a unit more than once (even if it's oversized)."
"","","Projectiles That Cause Forced Movement:  Some projectiles cause forced movement after they hit, e.g. 
[[Grapple Shot]] or [[Pudge Butcher]]. The forced movement path matches the projectile's path. (If 
[[Magellan Globe]] or [[Ruler of Thul]] is in the realm, you can't shoot the projectile one way, and 
then drag the other way around the realm.) See the '((Movement on the Storyline))' entry for more 
details."
"Random","Random effects are those that use the word 'random' or involve rolling a ))die((, e.g. [[Salmon of 
Knowledge]]. To determine a random outcome, use any reasonable method, such as rolling a ))die((, 
assigning equal probability to each possible outcome. For example, if there are three units at the 
location you target with [[Lightning Bolt]], you could assign 1-2 to the first unit, 3-4 to the 
second unit, and 5-6 to the third unit, then roll a six-sided ))die((.",""
"Range of Motion","A unit's range of motion is every location it could reach if it used the Move and Attack basic 
ability, ignoring all triggered abilities. If a unit can't use the Move and Attack basic ability 
(e.g. Disabled), then it has no range of motion. When determining which locations the unit can reach 
(and thus Defend there, or be forced to attack there via [[The Green Knight]], for example), the 
game looks ahead, considering all ongoing effects (including passive abilities) and ignoring all 
triggered abilities. Below are some examples to help illuminate these rules. Example 1  An 
[[Apprentice Wizard]] is in square A and the attack is happening in square E. The game foresees that 
the Apprentice Wizard can't reach square E and thus he can't tap to Defend. Example 2
Same as Example 1, but [[Magellan Globe]] is in the realm or [[Waypoint Portal]] is in effect. Now, 
the game notices the ongoing effect and allows the Defend ability. Example 3
The attack's location is [[Gnome Hollows]] and a [[Bosk Troll]] is at an adjacent site. The game 
foresee that the Bosk Troll won't be able to move into the Gnome Hollows because that's a passive 
effect, and thus the Troll can't tap to Defend. Example 4
The attack's location is [[Bottomless Pit]] and the Bosk Troll is adjacent. The game will allow the 
Defend ability, because the Troll can actually move there. Of course, the Bosk Troll will die upon 
arrival due to Bottomless Pit, but the Defend ability would be allowed. Example 5  The attack is 
happening at A. I have [[Rimland Nomads]] at N. There is a [[Giant Shark]] at S, which is a water 
site. As soon as the Rimland Nomads move toward A to Defend, the Shark will fight them at S via its 
mandatory triggered ability. There is no way that the Nomads could actually reach A in two steps. 
Nonetheless, the game will allow the Rimland Nomads to use the Defend ability because when the game 
looks ahead to see which locations the Nomads can reach, the game ignores all triggered abilities. 
Example 6
Same as Example 5, but instead of a Shark at S, it's a [[Bog]], having targeted itself. In this 
case, the game will not allow the Nomads to use the Defend ability, because the game considers all 
ongoing effects (including the Bog) and foresees that the Nomads can't reach the attack's location. 
The difference is that Giant Shark is a triggered ability (which is ignored during lookahead) and 
Bog is an ongoing ability (which is considered during lookahead). Lookahead Summary
In summary, if the player can demonstrate a movement path that would reach the attack's location, 
ignoring all triggered abilities, then the Defend ability is allowed. Explanation
If you're reading this deeply into the Codex, you might be wondering why the game ignores triggered 
abilities for the lookahead. One reason is that there are some cases where the lookahead for 
triggered abilities yields an unknown outcome. For example, in Example 5, instead of Nomads, if it 
were a [[Phantom Steed]] with a [[Poisonous Dagger]] carrying [[Amazon Warriors]], can the Phantom 
Steed reach A or not? It depends if the Shark chooses to fight the Warriors first or the Steed 
first. The second reason is that this approach allows the lookahead for mandatory actions like 'must 
attack' (e.g. [[Mask of Mayhem]]) to use the same rules, since players' intuition in those cases is 
to force an attack even into a Shark or [[Mariner's Curse]]. Therefore, we consistently ignore 
triggered abilities when considering a unit's range of motion.",""
"Ranged, Ranged X, and +X Range","Keyword Ability. Ranged is a keyword that grants a unit the following activated ability: Tap â Shoot 
a projectile that stops after 1 step. Strike the hit unit. If a unit has Ranged X, e.g. Ranged 3 on 
[[Fail-not Bow]], then replace '1 step' with 'X steps.' Multiple copies of the Ranged ability do not 
provide additional range, but if an effect explicitly uses +X Range, e.g. [[Vantage Hills]], then 
the number of steps the projectile can travel increases accordingly. The ranged projectile follows 
normal projectile rules. If the projectile hits a unit, the ranged shooter strikes the hit unit. 
This follows normal strike rules, even though the shooter and the struck unit might be in different 
locations, e.g. a Lance will inflict +1 damage and break. Note that the ranged ability shoots a 
projectile that may hit a unit; it will not hit sites, and thus cannot damage sites in that way (use 
the Move and Attack ability instead).",""
"Rarity","There are four levels of rarity in Sorcery, described below. Note that Avatars do not have a rarity 
listed on their typeline and thus don't have any rarity during gameplay, but you still only have one 
Avatar!",""
"","","Ordinary:  The lowest level of rarity. You may include up to 4 copies of an ordinary card (by name) 
in your deck."
"","","Exceptional:  The second lowest level of rarity. You may include up to 3 copies of an exceptional 
card (by name) in your deck."
"","","Elite:  The second highest level of rarity. You may include up to 2 copies of an elite card (by 
name) in your deck."
"","","Unique:  The highest level of rarity. You may include only 1 ))copy(( of a unique card (by name) in 
your deck."
"","","Curios:  We don't talk about curios!"
"Realm","The realm is all the squares in the game and everything in those squares. Typically the realm is a 
5x4 grid of squares.",""
"Region","There are exactly four regions in Sorcery: Surface Underwater Underground Void Even if a group of 
surface locations is separated by the void from another group of surface locations, there is still 
only a single surface region. Every surface location is part of the surface region. Every 
underground location is part of the underground region. Etc.",""
"Replacement Effect","Replacement effects replace one event with another. These types of effects often use the word 
'instead' and 'would,' with phrases like 'would die,' 'would take damage,' 'would successfully 
attack,' or 'would untap.' For example, [[Gilded Aegis]] is a replacement effect for a minion dying. 
It's constantly looking for the moment that minion is about to die, then it replaces that event (the 
minion dying) with a different event (healing the minion and banishing the Gilded Aegis). In such a 
situation, the minion never actually died, and the game was actually looking ahead just slightly to 
see it, then trigger and resolve the replacement effect. Note that replacement effects do not use 
the storyline; they immediately resolve as soon as they are triggered. See the 'Damage' codex entry 
and subsections for more details on damage-specific replacement effects.",""
"Royalty","Royalty is any card with King, Queen (or Queene), Prince, or Princess in its name. For example, 
[[Crown Prince]] and [[The Faerie Queene]] are royalty.",""
"Rubble","Rubble is a Ordinary site token with the ability 'Provides no mana.' It also has no affinity and is 
controlled by no one. When a site is destroyed, it leaves behind a Rubble token. When a site would 
enter the realm, it may replace a Rubble as if the Rubble were a void, following all other normal 
site placement rules. In all other ways, Rubble is treated the same as any other site. For example, 
because it has no water affinity, it is a land site.",""
"Sacrifice","You can only sacrifice cards you control and that are in the realm. If you are sacrificing as part 
of paying a cost for an effect, the sacrificed card doesn't go to the cemetery until the effect is 
resolved. For example, [[Sinkhole]]. If you try to sacrifice a card and it doesn't actually die 
(e.g. [[Lady Iseult]], [[Gilded Aegis]]) then you didn't actually sacrifice it, and thus you didn't 
pay whatever cost you were trying to pay.",""
"Search","Searching a zone (e.g. [[Adept Illusionist]]) allows you to look at the cards in those zones and 
potentially find something. If you search a public zone, then you must find what you're searching 
for, if possible. If you search a private zone, then you may choose to fail to find what you're 
searching for, even if it exists in that zone.",""
"Setup","Follow these steps to set up the game: Clearing some space in the middle of the table for the realm. 
Each player places their Avatar on the square in the middle of their bottom row. Players shuffle and 
place their atlas and spellbook decks somewhere close by, leaving some space for their cemeteries. 
Players randomly decide who goes first. Each player draws three cards from their atlas and three 
cards from their spellbook. The first player may mulligan up to three cards from their hand, placing 
them on the bottom of their respective decks in any order. Then, they redraw the same number of 
cards from each deck. The second player may mulligan in the same way. Some tournament rules may 
modify the setup procedure.",""
"Silenced","A silenced card loses all its special abilities. It retains its characteristics and its basic 
abilities. See the '((lose))' codex entry to understand what that word means in a Sorcery context.",""
"Site","A site is a locus of energy within the realm that provides you with mana to cast spells. Sites are 
usually played by activating your Avatar's ability, though they may enter the realm in other ways. 
You and your opponent may attack each other's sites to cause life loss, so make sure to place your 
sites carefully! [[MaelstrÃ¶m]] is an example of a site. When a site is destroyed, put it in its 
owner's cemetery, leaving behind a Rubble token. There is no limit to the number of cards that may 
occupy the same site. Sites have characteristics, specifically ((site characteristics)), and are one 
of the six card types in the game. To play a site, you will typically use your avatar's ability, 
though some other effects allow you to play sites in other ways, e.g. [[Frontier Settlers]]. If an 
effect instructs you to 'play a site' (e.g. [[Sorcerer]]), by default you must play it adjacent to 
one of your existing sites, or as close as possible to your avatar if you don't have any sites. If 
an effect instructs you to play a site with some positional information (e.g. [[Pathfinder]]), then 
card text takes precedence and you may ignore the 'adjacent to your existing sites' requirement. 
When cards refer to 'adjacent site' or 'nearby site,' see ((adjacent)) and ((nearby)) for clarity on 
how to resolve it.",""
"Span of Land","A span of land is a contiguous group of adjacent land sites, regardless of who controls those sites. 
If a card refers to 'its span of land' or 'this span of land,' it means the span of land occupied by 
that card. If that card doesn't currently occupy a span of land, then it doesn't have a span of 
land. To choose a span of land (e.g. [[Minecart Madness]]), choose one land site. Every land site 
(regardless of controller) that's connected to the chosen site via adjacent land sites is in that 
span of land. If a site becomes disconnected from the chosen land site (e.g. [[Earthquake]] in the 
middle of the turn), the disconnected site is no longer in the span of land. If the chosen site is 
no longer a land site (e.g. [[Flood]] in the middle of the turn), then the 'chosen span of land' no 
longer exists.",""
"Special Ability","Anything printed in the text box of a card is considered a special ability, as well as any other 
abilities it gains via other effects, e.g. [[Charge!]]. Special abilities have four categories, 
described in their own codex entries: Keyword ability Passive ability Activated ability Triggered 
ability",""
"Spell","Spells represent all of your prepared power to contest the realm. These include minions to help you 
defend your sites and attack the enemy, artifacts to tip the balance of power in your favor, magics 
to overpower your foes, and auras to impose your will on areas of the realm. Magics are a type of 
spell, but minions, artifacts, and auras are all spells as well! Every card in your spellbook is a 
spell! See casting spells for more details.",""
"Spellbook","Your spellbook is your deck of spells and is one of the zones in the game. Only spells can be placed 
or shuffled into your spellbook. If an effect would cause an atlas card to be shuffled into a 
spellbook, that effect is ignored. Constructed Format
Your spellbook must contain 50 or more spells and respect rarity limits. Limited Formats (Draft or 
Sealed)
Your spellbook must contain 24 or more spells, ignoring rarity restrictions.",""
"Spellcaster","Keyword Ability. A card with the Spellcaster keyword may cast spells. Avatars are automatically 
spellcasters. Some spellcasters may only cast spells that match a specific element. For example, 
[[Lava Salamander]] is a Fire Spellcaster, and thus may only cast spells that require Fire threshold 
(F).",""
"Split Power","Some units have split power, with a separate number for attack power and defense power. The first 
number is attack power and the second number is defense power. For example, [[White Knight]] has 3 
attack power and 5 defense power. Attack power is how much damage the unit will inflict when it 
strikes. For example, [[White Knight]] will deal 3 damage when it strikes. Defense power is how much 
damage the unit can take in a turn before it dies. For example, [[White Knight]] must take 5 or more 
damage in a turn to be killed. If an effect needs to know the 'power' of a unit with split power, 
e.g. [[Gnome Hollows]] or [[Chaos Twister]], take the average of the two numbers and round down, if 
needed. For example, a [[Brother Knight]] could enter Gnome Hollows and would deal 2 damage via 
Chaos Twister.",""
"Square","One grid square in the realm. The default size of the realm is a 5 x 4 grid of squares. When 
referring to squares, an effect can cross the boundaries of regions. The physical dimensions of a 
grid square can sometimes matter, e.g. [[Chaos Twister]]. Follow the golden rule and tournament 
rules, but reasonable sizes are between 4.5' and 5'.",""
"Start Phase","The start phase is the first phase you complete during your turn. Follow these steps in order: All 
abilities that last 'Until next turn' now end. All of your cards untap. All of your sites (and other 
cards) provide their mana for this turn. Trigger and resolve abilities that happen at the start of 
the turn. Draw a card from either your spellbook or atlas. On the first player's first turn of the 
game, they do not draw a card.",""
"Stealth","Keyword Ability. Minions with Stealth cannot be targeted by spells or abilities from your opponents 
(including attacks), their attacks cannot be defended, they cannot be intercepted, and projectiles 
cannot hit them. Stealth is tracked with a stealth token. Stealth is lost after the minion interacts 
with the realm. Non-minions cannot have Stealth. If a minion with Stealth becomes a non-minion, 
remove the Stealth token and they lose Stealth.",""
"","","When exactly is 'after'?:  Stealth is lost 'after' interacting with the realm, so here is a precise 
explanation of when 'after' occurs for the ways Stealth could be lost. Important note: If a minion 
loses Stealth for multiple reasons (e.g. activated ability that causes damage and does other 
things), the minion loses Stealth after the first reason. Activate a special ability: Resolve the 
entire ability, including any Deathrites. Once the Storyline is empty, Stealth is lost. Deal Damage: 
Resolve any effects concurrent with dealing damage (e.g. [[Daperyll Vampire]] gaining life based on 
a strike). Stealth will be lost before Deathrites resolve. Note: even if the damage is prevented 
(e.g. [[Shield Maidens]]), Stealth will still be lost. Strike: Resolve any effects concurrent with 
dealing damage (e.g. [[Daperyll Vampire]] gaining life based on a strike, or the controlling avatar 
losing life if a site was struck). Stealth will be lost before Deathrites resolve. Note: even if the 
strike is for 0 damage (e.g. [[Grandmaster Wizard]]), Stealth will still be lost. Cast a spell: 
Resolve the entire spell, including any Deathrites. Once the Storyline is empty, Stealth is lost."
"Step","Step has two meanings in Sorcery! A step is the smallest measure of distance in Sorcery, equal to 
the distance between two adjacent locations in the same region, e.g. 'up to 2 steps away' on cards 
like [[Dispel]]. A step is also the smallest distance a unit can travel when moving, e.g. 'take a 
step' on cards like [[Leap Attack]]. If an effect uses 'up to X steps away,' use the first 
definition. Movement abilities do not apply because you're not moving anywhere, you're checking 
distance. Simply count 1 adjacent square per step, without crossing region boundaries. Examples 
include [[Payload Trebuchet]] and [[Sleep]]. If an effect uses 'push/pull/drag one step,' also use 
the first definition, because the unit is not moving of their own volition. This is forced movement. 
Simply count 1 adjacent square per step, without crossing region boundaries. Examples include 
[[Whirlwind]] and [[Wind Sylph]]. If an effect uses 'take a step' or 'move one step,' the unit is 
moving itself and may use abilities like Airborne, Voidwalk, Burrow, and Submerge, crossing region 
boundaries. Use the second definition. An Immobile unit could not 'take a step' at all. Examples 
include [[Guile Sirens]], which could make a nearby Airborne enemy take a diagonal step toward them, 
and [[Leap Attack]], which could allow a Burrowed minion to unburrow to the surface and strike all 
the units there. Note that the Moves Freely ability only applies during the 'Move and Attack' and 
'Defend' basic abilities.",""
"Stops","After a unit moves, it 'stops' when there is no additional movement for that unit on the storyline. 
A unit must first move to then stop. Projectiles are similar; if they do not enter a new location, 
the projectile hasn't moved at all and thus cannot stop. For example, a [[Snowball]] that doesn't 
enter any new locations and doesn't move will not deal any damage. Note that 'stops' is not the same 
as at rest. As a complicated example, consider casting [[Blink]] with an [[Orb of Ba'al Berith]] 
nearby. Both Blink spells will be on the storyline. After the first Blink resolves, whatever unit 
just moved will 'stop,' since there's no other movement for that unit on the storyline immediately 
after the first Blink resolves; the ally for the second Blink hasn't been chosen yet. If the same 
unit is chosen for the second Blink, it will stop a second time (assuming it changes locations after 
each Blink to actually result in movement).",""
"Storyline","When the story being told during a game of Sorcery starts to get complicated, particularly when 
multiple abilities trigger at the same time, use the storyline to resolve them.",""
"","","Most Effects Use The Storyline:  A storyline begins each time a spell is cast, or an ability is 
activated or triggered. For example, when you cast the [[Plumed Pegasus]] spell, the spell goes onto 
the storyline, and then it resolves from the storyline. The same is true for abilities. For example, 
when you tap a unit to use the 'Move and Attack' basic ability, the ability itself goes onto the 
storyline, then resolves from the storyline. Minion, aura, and artifact spells enter the realm after 
they resolve, while magic spells go to the cemetery after they resolve. When casting spells, or 
activating or triggering abilities, please note the 'target' rules."
"","","Some Effects Do Not Use the Storyline:  Note that replacement effects, prevention effects, and 
ongoing effects do not use the storyline. See those codex entries for further details."
"","","Splitting Events on the Storyline:  As some events are resolving from the storyline, they split up 
into smaller events. Note that events are only split up as they are resolving, and not when they are 
added to the storyline. The following are the reasons to split up an event as it resolves from the 
storyline: A card enters or leaves the realm A card moves in the realm Explicit card text, e.g. 'one 
at a time' on [[Firebolts]] or [[Tactical Move]] For example, let's say the realm looks like this:  
I have an allied at [[Azuridge Caravan]] at A. Site R is a [[Summer River]]. There's an enemy [[Lady 
Iseult]] at I. I cast [[Grapple Shot]]. The storyline will look like this: Grapple Shot effect If 
there were any cast triggers (e.g. [[Enchantress]], [[Fenvale Muse]], [[Ring of Morrigan]], etc.), 
those ((new events interrupt the storyline)). Assuming for now we don't have those, Grapple Shot 
starts to resolve. I choose Azuridge Caravan as the ally, who shoots a projectile, hitting Lady 
Iseult. At this moment, the Caravan needs to move, so we handle the ((movement on the storyline)). 
The movement path is set, and now Grapple Shot is split into smaller events, so the storyline now 
looks like this: DONE: first part of Grapple Shot Azuridge Caravan moves from surface of A to 
surface of R Azuridge Caravan moves from surface of R to surface of I Remaining part of Grapple Shot 
The events on the storyline continue to resolve now, and triggered abilities may insert themselves 
as needed, since ((new events interrupt the storyline)). Another Example of Splitting Events
Let's say I use the [[Druid]]'s ability to play a site and summon Tawny. I tap the Druid and the 
storyline looks like this: Druid's ability (Play or draw a site. If you played a site and you don't 
control Tawny, summon her there.) So, the ability starts to resolve and I play my site. As soon as a 
card enters the realm, the event on the storyline splits, so it now looks like: DONE: first part of 
Druid's ability (Play or draw a site) Remaining part of Druid's ability (If you played a site and 
you don't control Tawny, summon her there.) Since ((new events interrupt the storyline)), here's 
what the storyline would look like if the site had a genesis ability, e.g. [[Red Desert]]: DONE: 
first part of Druid's ability (Play or draw a site) Red Desert's genesis ability Remaining part of 
Druid's ability (If you played a site and you don't control Tawny, summon her there.) The Red 
Desert's genesis ability is inserted before the remaining part of the Druid's ability. The Red 
Desert's genesis ability must resolve before Tawny is summoned.
 Special Case for Search Effects
If an effect causes you to search, then do something that would normally cause a storyline event to 
be split, and then do something else with the searched cards, you complete the entire search process 
before splitting the event. For example, if [[Brother Knight]]'s genesis ability is resolving and I 
search my deck, then summon the other Brother Knight, normally a card entering the realm would cause 
the event to split on the storyline. E.g. a [[Giant Shark]] or [[Bottomless Pit]] might interrupt 
the rest of the first Brother Knight's genesis ability. But, in fact, you must complete the entire 
search process and shuffle your deck before allowing any triggered abilities to insert themselves 
into the storyline. The Giant Shark or Bottomless Pit could absolutely still trigger, but your deck 
would be shuffled before they do!"
"","","Movement on the Storyline:  When you need to specify movement from an effect on the storyline, the 
entire movement path goes onto the storyline before any movement actually resolves. Each step is 
resolved one at a time, but the whole movement path is placed on the storyline first. See 
((Splitting Events on the Storyline)) for an example of [[Grapple Shot]], and see ((Projectiles That 
Cause Forced Movement)) for more details. Some effects cause movement to a specific location without 
specifying the path, e.g. [[Giant Shark]]. When such an effect resolves from the storyline, you must 
specify the shortest path that would allow the unit to actually reach the desired destination, 
ignoring triggered abilities. If there are multiple such paths, the controller of the effect chooses 
among the tied routes. If there is no valid path that allows the unit to reach its destination (e.g. 
[[Iceberg]]), do not move at all."
"","","New Events Interrupt The Storyline:  If the resolution of one event triggers a new event, the new 
event will be inserted into the storyline just before the triggering event. The new event 
temporarily interrupts any remaining events on the storyline. Once the new event has been resolved, 
the story continues. For example, if you cast [[Plumed Pegasus]] while carrying the [[Ring of 
Morrigan]], the sequence will be: 1) Cast Plumed Pegasus. The storyline looks like this: Summon 
Plumed Pegasus to the surface of site 8 2) Ring of Morrigan notices the 'cast' trigger, and now the 
storyline looks like this: Ring of Morrigan ability Summon Plumed Pegasus to the surface of site 8 
3) Then, you resolve the Ring of Morrigan ability. Note that the Plumed Pegasus spell hasn't 
resolved yet, so it's still on the storyline and not in the realm. The storyline looks like this: 
DONE: Ring of Morrigan ability Summon Plumed Pegasus to the surface of site 8 4) Then, the Plumed 
Pegasus spell resolves. The storyline looks like this: DONE: Ring of Morrigan ability DONE: Summon 
Plumed Pegasus to the surface of site 8 And the Plumed Pegasus is now in the realm."
"","","Simultaneous Triggers:  If multiple events are competing to be added at the same point on the 
storyline, the active player adds all of their events first, in the order of their choice. Then, the 
non-active player add their events in the order of their choice. The non-active player's events will 
end up resolving first, since newly added events always interrupt what's already on the storyline. 
See the example below. It's my turn and I cast [[Apprentice Wizard]] to the surface of my 
[[Bottomless Pit]]. Also, my Bottomless Pit happens to be flooded and you have a [[Mariner's Curse]] 
there. The storyline starts like this: Summon Apprentice Wizard to the surface of Bottomless Pit 
There are no triggers yet, because the Wizard isn't the realm yet. So, we resolve the storyline and 
it looks like this: DONE: Summon Apprentice Wizard to the surface of Bottomless Pit Now, the 
Apprentice Wizard is in the realm, and we have three simultaneous triggers! As the active player, I 
declare mine first in the order of my choice. I order them like this: Apprentice Wizard Genesis 
(Draw a spell) Bottomless Pit ability (Kill Apprentice Wizard since it doesn't have Airborne) Then, 
as the non-active player, you declare your ability and add it ahead of mine. The storyline now looks 
like this: Mariner's Curse ability (Submerge Apprentice Wizard and return to hand) Apprentice Wizard 
Genesis (Draw a spell) Bottomless Pit ability (Kill Apprentice Wizard since it doesn't have 
Airborne) And then those three effects will resolve in order, yours first, then mine. See the 
'((Source is No Longer in the Realm))' example below for more details."
"","","Simultaneous Effects:  Sometimes multiple effects occur simultaneously, as a single event on the 
storyline. For example, [[Windblast]] involves many cards moving, but they all move simultaneously 
and are treated as a single event on the Storyline. Simultaneous effects are different from 
((simultaneous triggers)). Effects are simultaneous and are resolved as a single event on the 
storyline if they use language like 'everything.' E.g. [[Peasant Revolt]] can simultaneously destroy 
many cards. An effect is also simultaneous if it uses language like 'each' or 'all,' without also 
using 'one at a time.' For example, [[MaelstrÃ¶m]] simultaneously moves many minions and [[Boneyard]] 
simultaneously summons two minions, but [[Tactical Move]] is resolved as separate events on the 
storyline."
"","","Source is No Longer in the Realm:  If the source of a storyline event was in the realm but then 
leaves the realm before the event resolves, the event is ignored and does not actually resolve. 
Simply proceed to the next event on the storyline. Continuing from the example in '((Multiple 
Simultaneous Triggers))' above, the [[Apprentice Wizard]] entered the realm on the surface of a 
flooded [[Bottomless Pit]] with a [[Mariner's Curse]]. We have three events on the storyline, as 
follows: Mariner's Curse ability (Submerge Apprentice Wizard and return to hand) Apprentice Wizard 
Genesis (Draw a spell) Bottomless Pit ability (Kill Apprentice Wizard since it doesn't have 
Airborne) The Mariner's Curse resolves, submerging the Apprentice Wizard (who dies underwater 
without the submerge ability), and the Mariner's Curse returns to your hand. Now, the storyline 
looks like: DONE: Mariner's Curse ability Apprentice Wizard Genesis (Draw a spell) Bottomless Pit 
ability (Kill Apprentice Wizard since it doesn't have Airborne) Now, the Apprentice Wizard's Genesis 
ability tries to resolve, but the Apprentice Wizard is no longer in the realm. The genesis ability 
cannot resolve and is ignored. I do not draw a spell. Now, the storyline looks like: DONE: Mariner's 
Curse ability IGNORED: Apprentice Wizard Genesis Bottomless Pit ability (Kill Apprentice Wizard 
since it doesn't have Airborne) The Bottomless Pit ability resolves. It tries to kill the Apprentice 
Wizard and fails, since the Apprentice Wizard is already dead. If a specific event has started to 
resolve and got split up (per the ((Splitting Events on the Storyline)) rules), that event will 
continue to resolve even if the source leaves the realm."
"Strike","Strike simply means to deal damage equal to the unit's power. For example, if a [[Bosk Troll]] 
strikes, it strikes for 3 damage. In a fight, units strike each other simultaneously. Some abilities 
allow units to strike first, e.g. Lance. Split power units deal damage equal to their attack power 
when they strike.",""
"","","Strikes vs. Multiple Units:  At the moment a strike is resolving against multiple units, the 
controller of the striking unit declares how to split up the damage among the struck units. The 
damage may be split up however you prefer, including assigning zero damage to some units (see 
below). The total damage assigned must equal the total power of the strike. Units assigned zero 
damage are still considered struck, and the striking unit makes a total of one strike, split among 
multiple units. The damage is inflicted simultaneously on all units."
"","","Strikes for Zero Damage:  A strike for zero damage, e.g. [[Grandmaster Wizard]], is still a strike, 
even though it doesn't do damage. See the 'zero' codex entry for more details."
"Submerge","Keyword Ability. A minion with Submerge can be summoned to underwater locations and survive 
underwater. By using one step, a minion with Submerge can move between the surface and subsurface of 
a water site, or between adjacent underwater locations. For example, [[Coral-reef Kelpie]] can be 
summoned underwater to one of your water sites. Then, after their summoning sickness wore off, they 
could use their Move and Attack ability to take a step from underwater to the surface of that site 
(and that would use up their step). If they were on the surface of a water site, they could use 
their step to move from the surface to underwater of that site. To 'submerge' means to move from the 
surface to the underwater of a water site. When an effect 'submerges' a card, you forcefully move 
that card from the surface to underwater, even if it doesn't have the Submerge ability. If an effect 
tries to forcefully submerge (e.g. [[Drown]]) a card that occupies at least one land site, the 
effect fails.",""
"Subsurface","The bottom layer of a site. The subsurface of a water site is underwater. The subsurface of a land 
site is underground. Void squares do not have a subsurface (or surface).",""
"Subtypes","Subtypes provide additional theme and flavor for a card. Subtypes are capitalized and shown in the 
card's typeline. For example, the card [[Roaming Monster]] has the 'Monster' subtype. In general, 
subtypes have no inherent game effect, but other cards may refer to them. For example, [[King of the 
Realm]] cares about the Mortal subtype. Artifacts have two special subtypes ('((Automaton))', 
'((Monument))') that do have inherent game rules. See the those codex entries for more details.",""
"Summon","Summon means 'enter the realm,' for minions. When you cast a minion spell, the result is that you 
summon that minion, following normal restrictions about casting spells. When another effect causes 
you to summon a minion directly without casting it, e.g. [[Mother Nature]], [[Brother Knight]], 
[[Knighthood]], etc., you simply put it into the realm. You don't need to pay mana, meet threshold 
requirements, or choose a location you control, as you usually do when you cast a minion spell. 
Typically a summon effect will specify where the summoned minion appears. For example, [[Mother 
Nature]] specifies that the minion is summoned 'here,' i.e., Mother Nature's location, even if 
that's an enemy site. If a summon effect does not specify where the summoned minion appears, e.g. 
[[Raise Dead]] or [[Plague of Frogs]], you may summon it to any location in any region. If you try 
to summon a minion to a location that it can't enter, e.g. [[Gnome Hollows]], it doesn't change 
zones and remains where it was.",""
"Summoning Sickness","A minion that entered the realm this turn, whether from being cast or from another card's effect, 
suffers from ))summoning(( sickness until the end of turn. A minion suffering from ))summoning(( 
sickness cannot tap, or be tapped, to pay for costs associated with any ability. This includes any 
additional abilities that may have been granted by spells and artifacts. When you summon a minion on 
your turn, it enters play untapped, so you may use it to defend on your opponent's turn.",""
"Surface","Surface has two meanings in Sorcery! Sorry about that! English is tricky. Surface as a noun means 
'the top layer of a site,' as in 'the surface of a site.' This is the more common usage of the word, 
which you can see on [[Buried Treasure]], [[Teleport]], or [[Bone Rabble]]. Surface as a verb means 
'to move up from underwater,' as in 'surface the submerged minion.' You can see examples of this on 
[[Diluvian Kraken]], [[Iceberg]], and [[Mudflow]]. Void squares do not have a surface (or 
subsurface).",""
"Tap","Cards in the realm can be tapped as a cost to activate various abilities. A player may also need to 
tap a card as a cost related to spells or abilities on other cards. A minion with summoning sickness 
cannot tap or be tapped to pay costs (but may be tapped directly by other effects, e.g. [[Grievous 
Insult]]). To tap a card, turn a it 90Â° to the right, from an upright position. Only untapped cards 
in the realm can be tapped.",""
"Target","A target is the chosen object of a spell or effect. It uses the word 'target,' and choosing a target 
is required. For example, [[Arc Lightning]] has a target of a 'nearby unit' and [[Red Desert]] has a 
target of 'nearby site.' The source of the ability, or the caster of the spell, must be in the same 
region as everything it targets. When you cast a spell or use an ability that targets, before it 
even goes on the storyline, you must declare all targets. For example, [[Bury]] is a spell that 
targets, and [[Vile Imp]] has an ability that targets. You must declare a legal target as the effect 
goes on the storyline, and the legality of the target is checked again when the effect actually 
resolves. If you cannot declare a legal target when the spell or ability would enter the storyline, 
the spell isn't actually cast and the ability can't be used. See '((Casting Magics))' for more 
details.",""
"Tawny","Tawny is a token minion with 1 power. She is a Unique Beast with 'Airborne, Spellcaster, Can't 
defend.' Tawny is an ((air)) minion. See [[Druid]].",""
"Teleport","Teleportation is forced movement directly from one location to another. Teleportation does not cross 
borders, and does not have a defined cardinal direction (even if the two locations are in the same 
row or column). Teleportation from the same location to itself is not movement at all; in that case, 
the unit never left the location and never entered it again. See the 'Oversized Units' codex entry 
for more details on teleportation with oversized units.",""
"The Golden Rule","The Golden Rule of Sorcery is that some text is intentionally informal or necessarily compact. Use 
common sense and be cool.",""
"The Silver Rule","When card text and rules text conflict, specific card text takes precedence when there is a direct 
conflict. See also the 'Can vs. Can't' codex entry. The priority from highest to lowest is: Specific 
card text that says you 'can't' do something. Specific card text that says you 'can' do something. 
Rules text that says you 'can't' do something. Rules text that says you 'can' do something.",""
"There","'There' refers to the location(s) that the card occupies. For most cards, such as minions and 
artifacts, that means one location. For example, [[Backstab]]'s use of 'there' means the adjacent 
location of the tapped minion. For auras, that usually means 4 locations, most commonly the surface 
of 4 sites. For sites, 'there' includes both the site's surface location and it's subsurface 
location. For example, [[Upwelling]] will return subsurface minions and artifacts as well as those 
on the surface. 'There' is analogous to 'here.'",""
"Token","Token cards are equivalent to normal cards while in the realm. If they would ever leave the realm, 
they are banished instead. Tokens have a default cost of zero, though if the token is a copy of 
another card it will copy that card's characteristics. Players may use anything they wish to 
represent tokens, as long as the game state is clear. The owner of a token is typically whoever put 
it into play, but if a card is transformed into a token, e.g. [[Pollimorph]] or [[Degradation]], the 
owner of the transformed card is the owner of the token. Typical token minions include: Foot Soldier 
token Frog token Tawny Bruin Typical token sites include: Rubble Typical token artifacts include: 
Lance",""
"Top","'Top' can have two different meanings in Sorcery, depending on context. When referring to your deck, 
top or topmost simply means the top card of the deck. For example, [[Mother Nature]]. When referring 
to the realm, top means the row farthest from you. For example, [[Polar Explorers]].",""
"Top Border","The 'top border' of a site is the border farthest from your starting edge. This is relevant for a 
few cards like [[Perilous Bridge]]. 'Top border' is player-relative. If the control of such a card 
changes, the direction it perceives as 'top border' will also change.",""
"Tournament Rules","Sorcery is intended to be played in whatever way you and your friends find most enjoyable! If you're 
attending a tournament, it's wise to be aware of the rules that will apply, ensuring that everyone 
attending the event understands how it will work. Tournament organizers are empowered to modify the 
rules to maximize the fun of the players in their community, including banning or modifying cards, 
modifying the setup rules to provide some compensation for going second, etc. For example, one such 
setup rule is that after mulligans, the second player may look at the top card of their spellbook or 
the top card of their atlas, and then may put that card on the bottom. Please check with the 
tournament organizer of any events you attend to ensure you understand the rules that will be in 
effect, and most importantly, have fun!",""
"Transform","When a card transforms, its printed abilities and characteristics change to match its new form, but 
it is otherwise the same game object. That means the new form does not 'enter the realm' and does 
not trigger any 'enter the realm' effects like Genesis - it was there all along! Furthermore, since 
the new form doesn't enter the realm, it will not suffer from summoning sickness, assuming the old 
form didn't enter the realm this turn. If one card transforms into a different card, the original 
card is banished but game effects treat it as the same game object. For example, if you play 
[[Pollimorph]] on my [[Apprentice Wizard]], I end up with a Frog token under my control and the 
Apprentice Wizard card is banished. If some game effect was tracking the Apprentice Wizard, it is 
now tracking the Frog token. If one card transforms into a different type, e.g. [[Island 
Leviathan]], continue to use the same card. When a card transforms, it does not die and deathrites 
do not trigger. For example, if you [[Pollimorph]] my [[Kettletop Leprechaun]] into a Frog token, I 
do not resolve the Leprechaun's deathrite. As mentioned above, the printed abilities and 
characteristics change to match the new form upon transformation. For example, if a [[Plumed 
Pegasus]] is [[Shapeshift]]ed into [[Great Old One]], it no longer has Airborne or 3 power, and its 
Genesis does not trigger. Instead, it has Submerge and 16 power. In contrast, any ongoing effects 
continue to apply to the new form! For example, if I cast [[Power of Flight]] on my [[Bosk Troll]] 
and then I [[Shapeshift]] it into [[Great Old One]], it does have Airborne until my next turn, since 
Power of Flight applies to the game object and isn't a printed ability. The game treats the new form 
as the same game object. For example, if the old form was tapped, had taken damage, and was carrying 
an artifact, the new form will also be tapped, have damage, and will be carrying that artifact. Note 
that Stealth, though a printed keyword on many cards, is tracked via a Stealth token. Therefore, a 
Stealth token will carry over to the new form. For example, if I [[Shapeshift]] a [[Band of 
Thieves]] with a Stealth token into a [[Great Old One]], it will still have the Stealth token. If I 
cast [[Fade]] on my [[Bosk Troll]] and then [[Shapeshift]] it into [[Great Old One]], then it will 
also still have the Stealth token. Unlike the Airborne example, Stealth is tracked via a token, 
which carries over. Finally, if you Shapeshift a minion into a new form with the printed Stealth 
keyword, Stealth will not trigger since it's an 'enters the realm' effect. You only get the Stealth 
token when the minion enters the realm, and it's not entering the realm when transforming.",""
"Traverse","Traverse means to move through a border. For example, [[Wall of Brambles]] specifies that it sits 
atop a border of a site. [[Perilous Bridge]] has a passive ability which affects its top border. To 
move through a border, a unit must take a step which causes it to enter a location on one side of 
the border, having occupied a location on the other side of the border.",""
"","","On the Ground:  Some effects use the phrase 'traverse on the ground,' e.g. [[Wall of Brambles]]. To 
'traverse on the ground,' a unit must move from the surface of a site to the surface of another 
site, excluding Airborne and Teleportation."
"Triggered Ability","A triggered ability specifies a condition and then an effect. Triggered abilities use words such as 
'when,' 'whenever,' and 'at [a specified moment].' For example, [[Scourge Zombies]] have a triggered 
ability.",""
"Turn Overview","Your turn has three phases: Start phase Main phase End phase",""
"Unburrow","Unburrow means 'to move up from underground.' For example, [[Mudflow]].",""
"Uncontrolled","Some cards in the realm are uncontrolled, meaning that neither player controls them. For example, a 
carriable artifact that's not currently being carried is uncontrolled. If an uncontrolled card has a 
trigger, e.g. [[Angel's Egg]], the owner of the card orders the trigger with other effects they 
control, as needed.",""
"Under","At the subsurface of a site (not void).",""
"Underground","The subsurface of land sites. Whenever a minion without Burrowing occupies an underground location, 
it immediately dies. An avatar may never enter an underground location. Underground is one of the 
four regions in the realm.",""
"Underwater","The subsurface of water sites. Whenever a minion without Submerge occupies an underwater location, 
it immediately dies. An avatar may never enter an underwater location. Underwater is one of the four 
regions in the realm.",""
"Unit","A unit is a collective term that includes Avatars and minions. Some cards might specify only 
minions, or only Avatars, but many cards affect units in general.",""
"Untap","To untap a card, turn it upright. All of your cards in the realm untap during your Start phase.",""
"Void","A square without a site is a void. Minions in the void are immediately banished unless they have 
Voidwalk. Unlike sites that have two locations (surface and subsurface), a void square only has a 
single location, the void. Voids do not have a surface or subsurface. Avatars in the void have a 
mandatory action.",""
"Voidwalk","Keyword Ability. A minion with Voidwalk can be summoned to void locations and survive in the void. 
Whenever a minion without Voidwalk occupies a void location, it is immediately banished. An avatar 
may never enter the void. By using one step, a minion with Voidwalk can move between the surface of 
a site and the void, the subsurface of a site and the void, or between adjacent void locations. For 
example, [[Hounds of Ondaros]] can be summoned to any void location. Then, after their summoning 
sickness wore off, they could use their Move and Attack ability to take a step from the void 
directly to the subsurface of an adjacent site, or directly to the surface of an adjacent site. If 
they were underground (or underwater or on the surface), they could use their step to move to an 
adjacent void.",""
"Water Site","A water site is a site that provides one or more water affinity. If a site provides water affinity 
and other types of affinity (e.g. earth), it's still a water site (and not a land site). If a site 
previously provided water affinity and then stops providing water affinity, then it also stops being 
a water site. 'Land site' and 'water site' are mutually exclusive. A site cannot be both a water 
site and a land site; it will always be one or the other.",""
"Waterbound","Keyword Ability. This minion is disabled while not occupying at least one water location. The 
waterbound ability persists even when disabled.",""
"Winning the Game","You win the game if you deal a death blow to your opponent's avatar, or if your opponent attempts to 
draw a card from an empty deck. There may be other effects that cause you to win the game, e.g. 
[[Wedding Hall]].",""
"Wounded","A wounded minion is one that has taken damage. A wounded Avatar is one that has current life less 
than its maximum life.",""
"You","'You' and 'your' in card text refers to the player. For example, [[Sparkmage]] cares about 'spells 
you've cast,' which includes any spells from any of your spellcasters. As another example, [[Bone 
Rabble]] would trigger if you used your Avatar's ability or if you used [[Frontier Settlers]]. Some 
older cards use the word 'you' to mean 'your avatar.' If it's impossible to read the card as 
'player' in a sensible way, then use 'avatar' instead. For example, [[Cerberus in Chains]] follows 
your avatar and [[Avatar of Earth]] looks at her own adjacent sites.",""
"Zero","In Sorcery, if there is zero of something, the game considers that thing to not exist at all. For 
example: If a unit takes zero damage, then it did not actually take any damage at all. Triggers 
looking for damage wouldn't be satisfied. If a unit takes zero steps, then it did not move at all. 
Triggers looking for movement wouldn't be satisfied. If you draw zero cards, you did not draw any 
cards at all. Triggers looking for card draws wouldn't be satisfied. etc. There are two notable 
exceptions: It is possible to strike for zero damage, e.g. [[Grandmaster Wizard]]. The unit still 
made a strike for effects that are looking for strikes (e.g. [[Phantasmal Shade]]), but the strike 
didn't do any damage at all. It's possible for units to have zero power and still exist in the 
realm. Units with 0 power (e.g. [[Grandmaster Wizard]]) only die if they take damage (1 or more). A 
spell cast for zero mana does not require any mana at all to cast, but it still counts as a cast 
spell.",""
"Zone","A zone is a general area where a card can exist. Game zones include: The realm (a shared zone) Each 
player's spellbook, atlas, cemetery, and hand zones (specific to each player) The storyline (a 
shared zone) Additional zones based on specific cards (e.g. [[Morgana le Fay]] creates a 'Morgana's 
hand' zone.) Public zones include the realm and cemeteries, and cards in these zones have no hidden 
information, i.e. they're face-up, and you're allowed to look at the opposite side of any card in 
those zones, e.g. [[Druid]]. For clarity of game state, it's acceptable to put banished cards 
face-down in a specific area of the table, but they may be reviewed by either player at any time. 
The number of cards and type of card (e.g. spell or site) in each zone is public information (e.g. 
any player can know how many cards remain in any deck, or how many cards of each type you have in 
your hand). Each player may view the cards in their own hand. Cards in the spellbook and atlas are 
face-down, and thus not visible to any player.",""
